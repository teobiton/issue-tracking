issue targets the long needed atomic memory support. \r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] Add support to execute AMOs without any of the ordering bits set\r\n- [ ] Add support for aq and rl bits\r\n- [x] Work on adding LR and SC instructions\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nGeneral there are 4 cases:\r\n\r\n**acquire semantic**: If the `aq` bit is set, then no later memory operations in this RISC-V hart can be observed to take place before the AMO.\r\n-> block issue until the atomic memory operation is resolved, wait on commit signal, flush cache, do AMO, write back\r\n\r\n**release semantic**: If the `rl` bit is set, then other RISC-V harts will not observe the AMO before memory accesses preceding the AMO in this RISC-V hart.\r\n-> block issue until no more outstanding loads (trivially met as the load unit will implicitly synchronize, structural hazard) or stores (wait for store buffer to drain), wait on AMO commit, flush cache, do AMO, write-back\r\n\r\n**sequentially consistent**: If both the `aq` and `rl` bits are set, the atomic memory operation is sequentially consistent and cannot be observed to happen before any earlier memory operations or after any later memory operations in the same RISC-V hart, and can only be observed by any other hart in the same global order of all sequentially consistent atomic memory operations to the same address domain.\r\n-> block issue until no more outstanding loads or stores, issue atomic, wait on commit signal, block issue until atomic comited, flush dcache, do amo, write-back\r\n\r\n**unordered**: aq and rl not set -> just issue -> wait for amo_commit -> flush dcache -> do AMO -> write back AMO\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n- **Decoder** (`decoder.sv`): The atomic instruction needs to be properly decoded. Most of the operations are there but this needs some further checking (especially if all parameters are set properly and illegal instructions are thrown in case of an illegal instruction with the `OPCODE_AMO`).\r\nDecoder will also need to block the decoding of any subsequent instructions in case the instruction requires release, acquire or sequential consistency. There is already an `amo_commit_i` signal which indicates that the atomic memory operation finished. If we block the issue stage we need to un-block it if the controller wants to flush.\r\n\r\n- **LSU - Data Cache** (`lsu.sv`, `nbdcache.sv`, `cache_ctrl.sv`): Those units will require the biggest amount of changes. Basically every atomic instruction should be treated as a load (because even the stores will return something: success or not). So we need to route those instructions similar to a load. The load unit will interface the dcache with an additional signal `amo_t amo_op_o` indicating whether the current operation is atomic (and which operation) or a regular load.\r\nIn case it is an atomic operation the `cache_ctrl ` FSM will enter a new state saving all information (address, op to perform, etc.) and wait for the `amo_commit_i` signal to go high or for `amo_flush_i` to go high. If the latter happens it will return to the idle state. If the `amo_commit_i` signal goes high the cache controller should flush the data cache and issue a new transaction on the bypass signal once the flush is done.\r\nHere we need to differentiate between LR/SC and the AMO OPs. LR/SC will need to use the AXI Lock infrastructure (see AXI Interface specification) to place a reservation (we will need to adapt the testbench for that) while the AMO OPs can retrieve the data process it locally with the AMO ALU. In every case the atomic memory operations will return some result on the `amo_result_o` signal together with a high `amo_valid_o`. Both signals go to the commit stage.\r\n> One further thing which needs a fix is to increase the the width of the dirty SRAM so that it holds a dirty bit per byte. The flush/cache line write-back logic needs to set the corresponding `wstrb` bits. That is because Ariane does not support cache-coherency at the moment and we need to explicitly take care of write-sequentialisation. \r\n\r\n- **Commit Stage** (`commit_stage.sv`): This unit will need to look at the retiring instruction and see that it is an atomic instruction.

\r\n\r\nNot sure, since there are no forums: I'm trying to synthesize it for an FPGA Xilinx xcvu9p* family,  I created a design block that connects the three AXI, to access brams, the goal it is evaluate if I can synthesize it for >= 200Mhz of frequency. \r\n\r\nHowever I'm facing a barrage of timing issues, that weren't expected, for things like, input and output pads:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n

here is synthesize it on an FPGA, to prove that this same core can be used on FPGA, ... I understand that it looks reverse path, but yes, on ASIC I'm sure on what to do, and I got the timing closure on ASIC flow. However in FPGA on Vivado it is being quite cumbersome, what have I forgot to do or add?\r\n\r\nBy the way I had to made a slight change in the code to use synchronous reset, otherwise, I was getting nowhere with timing in the FPGA. So I created a serieis of ifdefs to choose accoridng with a  MACRO modifier what to use:\r\n```\r\nifdef PULP_FPGA_EMUL\r\nalways @(posedge clk) \r\nelse\r\nalways @(posedge clk or negedge rstn)\r\nendif\r\n```\r\nI'm using the PULP_FGPA_EMUL, since I had to enable it to synthesize it for FPGAs.\r\n\r\nI have an oscillator of 300Mhz, that gets into a PLL,  and generates a 200 and 250 Mhz signals, that are the ones I'm using to feed the system.\r\n\r\nSDC/XDC clock constraints:\r\n```\r\ncreate_clock -period 3.333 [get_ports clk_in1_p]\r\nset_input_jitter [get_clocks -of_objects [get_ports clk_in1_p]] 0.033330000000000005\r\n\r\nset_property PHASESHIFT_MODE LATENCY [get_cells -hierarchical *adv*]\r\n\r\n//set the reset in a false path to prevent the timing report to goes bananas on the reset signals\r\nset_false_path -to [get_pins -hier *cdc_to*/D].\r\n```\r\nThere is a forum to discuss design issues like this one?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nVitorio.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/77/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/77/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/78","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/78/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/78/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/78/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/78","id":352398517,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTIzOTg1MTc=","number":78,"title":"Potential stale sign bit","user":{"login":"kuopinghsu","id":28172706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTcyNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28172706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu","html_url":"https://github.com/kuopinghsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuopinghsu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2018-08-21T06:11:56Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T13:05:58Z","closed_at":"2018-08-23T13:05:58Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"When I run the riscv-tests/benchmark on the verilator, I got following message\r\n\r\n*** FAILED *** (tohost = 1337)\r\n\r\nThis seems to have received an illegal instruction.

issue comes from the ```csr_regfile``` module. This module addresses the CSR registers using the enums ```riscv::CSR_XXXXX```, but in the ```perf_counters``` module, the performance counters are addressed using the enums ```riscv::PERF_XXXXX```.\r\n\r\nThe ```csr_regfile``` passes the address to the ```perf_counters``` as is, without modifying the actual value (output port called ```perf_addr_o```):\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* csr_regfile.sv */\r\n\r\n    // ----------------\r\n    // CSR Read logic\r\n    // ----------------\r\n    always_comb begin : csr_read_process\r\n        ...\r\n        // feed through address of performance counter\r\n        perf_addr_o = csr_addr.address;\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nSo for example, if we want to read the ```L1_DCM```, the ```riscv::CSR_L1_DCACHE_MISS``` value is 12'hC04, while the ```riscv::PERF_L1_DCACHE_MISS``` is 1. The way how Ariane handles the performance counters is the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* perf_counters.sv */\r\n   ...\r\n    always_comb begin : perf_counters\r\n        perf_counter_d = perf_counter_q;\r\n        ...\r\n        if (l1_dcache_miss_i)\r\n            perf_counter_d[riscv::PERF_L1_DCACHE_MISS] = perf_counter_q[riscv::PERF_L1_DCACHE_MISS] + 1'b1;\r\n        ...\r\n        // Read Port\r\n        if (!we_i) begin\r\n            data_o = perf_counter_q[addr_i[2:0]];\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nWhen we wanna read a counter, as we are chosing only the 3 last bits from ```addr_i```, its value, which is 12'hC04 is going to be 3'h4, and instead of reading the ```L1_DCM``` which are stored in the position 1, we will be reading the counter in the position number 4, which is ```riscv::PERF_LOAD```. Note that the ```addr_i``` value comes from the ```perf_addr_o``` output port of the ```csr_regfile``` module.\r\n\r\nAn easy solution is to decrease the address in the ```perf_counters``` module:\r\n```\r\n/* perf_counters.sv */\r\n   ...\r\n    always_comb begin : perf_counters\r\n        ...\r\n        // Read Port\r\n        if (!we_i) begin\r\n            data_o = perf_counter_q[addr_i[2:0]-3];\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr set the correct address value in the  ```csr_regfile``` module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* csr_regfile.sv */\r\n\r\n    // ----------------\r\n    // CSR Read logic\r\n    // ----------------\r\n    always_comb begin : csr_read_process\r\n        ...\r\n        // feed through address of performance counter\r\n        perf_addr_o = csr_addr.address - 3;\r\n    ...\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/164","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/164/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/164/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/164/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/164","id":400814001,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDA4MTQwMDE=","number":164,"title":"Project IceStorm Compatibility?","user":{"login":"sunnystormy","id":4072077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzIwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4072077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy","html_url":"https://github.com/sunnystormy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnystormy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2019-01-18T17:12:16Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T16:08:48Z","closed_at":"2019-02-01T16:08:48Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Is there a way I can try getting the core up and running on a Project IceStorm compatible FPGA?

the gdb/openocd debugger stops at a breakpoint, register A0 is always zero. If the programmer debugs any expression involving A0 at that point, the debugger may perform an illegal access. Since A0 is the first function parameter, this is a highly likely scenario if it contains a pointer. A workaround of adding a dummy first parameter in the source code to each function that might be stopped in the debugger fixes the problem. Single stepping involving instructions that read A0 gives the expected (non zero) answer. This is suggestive to me that reporting temporary registers used in the debugger service ROM is incorrect, or perhaps an API incompatibility in openocd.\r\n\r\nOpen On-Chip Debugger

For example 2.350988561514729E-38 / 2 => 0.

Hence a bugfix for the current div/sqrt is not a high priority at this time.\r\n\r\nLong-winded addendum\r\nThe result value you list is correct (under default rounding), however it's actually encoded as the smallest normal FP32 value 0x00800000. The infinitely precise result lies exactly between this result and the largest subnormal FP32 value.\r\nThe div/sqrt bugs we've seen so far concern off-by-one-ulp because of wrong rounding. What's possibly happening here seems to be that the mantissa is correctly rounded from all-ones (from the infinitely precise, subnormal result) up to all-zeroes, however the overflow produced from rounding doesn't seem to be added onto the (subnormal = 0) exponent. This leads to the zero result.\r\nI don't know whether this bug is contained to this subnormal/normal border case, but it might be possible that mantissa overflows from rounding in general are buggy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/250","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/250/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/250/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/250/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/250","id":449274922,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDkyNzQ5MjI=","number":250,"title":"Is it possible to use jlink for debugging?","user":{"login":"hyf6661669","id":18757974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU3OTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18757974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669","html_url":"https://github.com/hyf6661669","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyf6661669/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-05-28T13:38:16Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T16:55:38Z","closed_at":"2019-06-05T16:55:38Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"At present I only have a JLINK V9.

Currently we start testing the AI accelerator through Linux kernel running on arianne. The approach is putting several images into the sd card from host machine and process those in Linux kernel on digilent GENESYS2 FPGA.\r\nBut I'm not familiar with the Linux kernel. Here are Several questions:\r\n\r\n1.We cannot write to physical address (0xD0000000) for AI module configurations through pointers directly from C file in Linux. There should be a software driver handling this. Is there any example on such driver design?\r\n2. Seems that gcc is missing in the kernel, how to combine and load such driver?\r\n3. The current busybox based Linux kernel seems don't have standard library such as glibc (fopen)? How can we build this into the kernel? Please refer any tutorial in case there is.\r\n4.

It can be seen that `0x0` is predicted (at `Time = -11`) but discarded (`is_mispredict`) in the following step. The `0x0` instruction fetch makes it's way through the I$ to the PTW, where the invalid PTE is found, the exception created (`ptw.sv:222`) and eventually - unexpectedly - retired.

I commented out this command from the tcl script since it is just something related to output prints\r\n2) The line 91 in src/common _cells/src/lzc.sv was throwing syntax error near '. I looked at the latest version of this file in git and replaced that line with the latest copy to overcome the error. (The ariane soc was not getting the latest version of this file when i do git submodule and hence even a latest cloned version of ariane soc has this error)\r\nNow I am getting this error that 'dm' not declared. \r\nThere are also many warnings like stale IPs etc which overlooked for now. \r\n\r\nSince the master branch is having these issues, I wanted to try the release version 4.2 but that zipped release source code doesnt seem to have all the submodules. \r\nCan someone suggest me a way where I can easily generate the bitstream without having to resolve all these errors one by one ? \r\nPS: I know that there is a prebuilt bitstream in 4.2 release, but I want to create my own bitstream because I am planning on making some changes in the ariane core and generate bitstream for the changes. \r\n\r\nThanking you in advance.

Based on my understanding of the fence in the memory consistency model, it only needs to prevent the re-ordering of load-store instructions. I understand based on the current Ariane implementation, L1 cache needs to be flushed to remove some false data brought by the re-ordered loads.\r\n  \r\n  However, if I implement the fence instruction by preventing the load-store re-ordering, do I still need to flush the L1 cache or not? Based on the explanation of the fence instruction in the RISC-V manual, my implementation does not need to flush L1. However, I am afraid Ariane implements fence instruction for other reasons except for maintaining the memory-ordering as specified by the RISC-V manual.

A possible workaround would be to offset the addresses of such peripherals when reading, taking advantage of don't care bits in the address. However this means changes to driver source code, which to some extent nullifies the benefit of emulating a standard interface in the first place. issuing a fence instruction in between the write and the read solves the problem at the expense of performance.

If not, is there some way to work around it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/413","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/413/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/413/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/413/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/413","id":604081604,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MDQwODE2MDQ=","number":413,"title":"Code Error: include/riscv_pkg.sv","user":{"login":"Yi1101","id":59173643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTczNjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59173643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101","html_url":"https://github.com/Yi1101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-04-21T15:18:18Z","updated_at":"2020-04-22T14:48:57Z","closed_at":"2020-04-22T14:48:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"When I run the synthesis of  \"include/riscv_pkg.sv\", the command (runs at design_vision) as the following. \r\n>analyze -format sverilog ${DESIGN_DIR}/include/riscv_pkg.sv\r\nThe error occurs:\r\nError:  /home/ariane/include/riscv_pkg.sv:273: Package 'riscv' has not been analyzed for import or content extraction.

guys,\r\n\r\n  I am trying to use std_cache in the FPGA platform by compiling the project (make fpga) without the \"WT_DCACHE\". However, the system stuck after printing \"sd initialized!\". \r\n  \r\n  The interesting part is that if I disable caching the memory space from 0x83ffe000 to 0x84000000 which is 8KB size, the bootloader and OS can be launched successfully. Based on startup.S file in fpga\\src\\bootrom, 0x84000000 is the stack pointer address. It seems to me that the stack space cannot be cached when the Bootrom works, right? What caused this?\r\n\r\n  I totally understand that the std cache is not used now but I think it is still interesting to figure out the reason behind it. Any comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nXia","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/438","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/438/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/438/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/438/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/438","id":628174742,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MjgxNzQ3NDI=","number":438,"title":"failling to run ariane tandem","user":{"login":"suhasskrishanmurthy","id":46715211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzE1MjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46715211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy","html_url":"https://github.com/suhasskrishanmurthy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-06-01T05:56:06Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T08:32:08Z","closed_at":"2020-06-01T08:32:07Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi,\r\nI am trying to run ariane tandem, but it is saying there should be some header files in a directory called ./tb/riscv-isa-sim/install/include/spike .

My assumption is that\r\nchanging PTE entry attributes is not behaving correctly in ariane core. I would be happy to proven wrong and debug more in kernel and/or OpenSBI.

now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/443","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/443/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/443/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/443/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/443","id":635230845,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MzUyMzA4NDU=","number":443,"title":"synchronizer

BIN=$(RISCV)/riscv64-unknown-elf/share/riscv-tests/isa/rv64ui-v-bltu\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nAccording to ISA spec (from what I understood, I might be wrong), `stval` should be set to `0` unless core trapped because one of the following:\r\n* hardware breakpoint\r\n* instruction-fetch fault\r\n* load or store address-misaligned fault\r\n* access or page-fault exception\r\n* illegal instruction trap\r\n\r\nHowever, Ariane seems to set the value of `stval` when trapping due to `ecall` (which is not one of the above). It sets stval to `0x73` which is the machine code for ecall instruction. I suspect same maybe true for `mtval` csr.\r\n\r\nHere is Dromajo trace (read comments):\r\n```c\r\n// commit hundreds of instructions\r\n0 0x0000000000002e58 (0x00301a63)                        bne     zero, gp, pc + 20 \r\n0 0x0000000000002e6c (0x00100513) x10 0x0000000000000001 li      a0, 1\r\n0 0x0000000000002e70 (0x00000073)                        ecall\r\n1 0xffffffffffe000c4 (0x14011173) x2  0xffffffffffe096d0 csrrw   sp, sscratch, sp <-- trap due to ecall\r\n1 0xffffffffffe000c8 (0x00113423)                        sd      ra, 8(sp)\r\n1 0xffffffffffe000cc (0x00313c23)                        sd      gp, 24(sp)\r\n// commit more instructions\r\n1 0xffffffffffe00148 (0x100022f3) x5  0x8000000200006000 csrr    t0, sstatus\r\n1 0xffffffffffe0014c (0x10513023)                        sd      t0, 256(sp)\r\n1 0xffffffffffe00150 (0x141022f3) x5  0x0000000000002e70 csrr    t0, sepc \r\n1 0xffffffffffe00154 (0x10513423)                        sd      t0, 264(sp)\r\n1 0xffffffffffe00158 (0x143022f3) x5  0x0000000000000000 csrr    t0, stval // <-- reading stval\r\n[error] EMU PC ffffffffffe00158, DUT PC ffffffffffe00158\r\n[error] EMU INSN 143022f3, DUT INSN 143022f3\r\n[error] EMU WDATA 0000000000000000, DUT WDATA 0000000000000073 << mismatch\r\n[error] EMU MSTATUS 8000000a00006000, DUT MSTATUS 00000000\r\n[error] DUT pending exception 8 pending interrupt -1\r\n\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/449","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/449/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/449/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/449/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/449","id":641135585,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDExMzU1ODU=","number":449,"title":"The HW platform change","user":{"login":"Yi1101","id":59173643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTczNjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59173643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101","html_url":"https://github.com/Yi1101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yi1101/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-06-18T11:36:00Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T20:05:45Z","closed_at":"2020-06-23T20:05:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Dear Author,\r\nIt seemed that the screen change into[ openhwgroup/cva6](url) the day before yesterday.

Adding the netlist of ariane core (without sram, which has been pragmaed when run DC) \r\n> 3. Adding other needed modules and submodules in ariane_testharness.sv\r\n> 4. The sram use the behavioral one\r\n> 5. Running the bash file and the elf file is the one provided in the front page` \"Hello Ariane\"`\r\n> 6.

Every time run the QuestaSim, tbh, I don't know which module and signal should I check？？？ I just waiting the result print on the Transcipt. If it shows \"Hello Ariane\" and then I know it works.\r\n> 2. As I know, the elf file needs to be add into SRAM beforehand, that is the way of bevioral SRAM, but when using the SRAM macros, how to add elf into SRAM macros？？？   \r\n> 3.

Then the RAS module will has error, for the overflow of the signal, so in my opinion, when set  `RASDepth: 0`, I should delete all the RAS related module in Ariane, am I right???\r\n\r\nReally looking forward to your reply!!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/455","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/455/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/455/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/455/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/455","id":642494648,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDI0OTQ2NDg=","number":455,"title":"torture tests is not running","user":{"login":"suhasskrishanmurthy","id":46715211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzE1MjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46715211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy","html_url":"https://github.com/suhasskrishanmurthy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suhasskrishanmurthy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-06-21T04:51:20Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T08:28:19Z","closed_at":"2020-06-22T08:28:19Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"HI, \r\n   I am trying to generate torture test sequence but it is getting stuck.It could'nt download scala library.

there,\r\nComing back to simulations again, this time, I wanted to dump waveforms to `fst` instead of `vcd` during simulation, readily, to save memory. This is because of previous simulation results leading up to 20GB dumped vcd size. That was for simple `c=a+b` C source file with command `work-ver/Variane_testharness -v=dump.vcd $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk arithmetic.elf.` However, after converting that vcd file to `fst` with `vcd2fst`, filesize surprisingly reduced to 57.6MB. \r\n\r\nSo, first of all, I tried to replace `--trace` with `--trace-fst` in Ariane Makefile according to Verilator manual and also tried to change `ariane_tb.cpp` for `VerilatedFstC` objects and `#include headers`, but things went unsuccessful. I think I am missing some important points. Could you help me with this extent? By the way, I have also tried to refer to [related RocketChip issue](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/issues/1689), however, that went unsuccessful too.

The type of register is saved in a 2-bit value with the three values:\r\n\r\nConstant\r\nScalar\r\nFloating-Point\r\n\r\nThis would reduce the register from 7-bits to 2-bits. \r\nThis is already done in the scoreboard to speed-up the register arbitration. \r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/465bb209a02721cbaa6fa82a87df2eb464a39e60/src/scoreboard.sv#L70\r\n\r\nWhat if this always done?\r\n\r\nThe decoder would be bigger but the register arbitration could be even faster. Only the type for the destination register is saved currently. With this change also the type for the source register would be saved. \r\nThis would reduce the calculation if the destination and source register are of the same type. Only 4 bits then store all the necessary information. For FPGA this change is even better as most modern FPGA use LUTs with 4 or 6 inputs. This calculation can, therefore, be done with only one LUT.\r\n\r\nThe number of operations could even be reduced.  When the type of register is not saved in the operation itself. Different types of the same operation could be removed. For example, scalar add and floating-point add could be merged, as the Execution Unit is also determined by the decoder.\r\n\r\nThe integration of the constant type would also eliminate the need for the use_imm and use_zimm flags from the scoreboard entry.\r\n\r\nThis change would therefore only need 4 additional FFs per scoreboard entry.\r\n2 FFs for the type of the destination register + 4 FFs for the two source registers - 2 FFs for the use_imm and use_zimm flag\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen floating-point is not used the type could be changed to a 1-bit value:\r\n\r\nConstant\r\nScalar\r\n\r\nThis meaning is then similar to the use_imm and use_zimm flags.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear your opinions on this matter.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRaphael Klink\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/465","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/465/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/465/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/465/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/465","id":650286489,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTAyODY0ODk=","number":465,"title":"A quick question about the XFVEC in Ariane","user":{"login":"zhaoxiahust","id":1435307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1435307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaoxiahust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoxiahust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2205679187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA1Njc5MTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Type:Question","name":"Type:Question","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":"For general questions"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-07-03T01:42:29Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T14:49:54Z","closed_at":"2020-07-15T14:49:54Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi guys,\r\n\r\n  In ariane, XFVEC represents whether the vectorial float extension (Xfvec) is enabled or not.

find a corner case associated with BranchPrediction/std_icache/PTW when we try to boot the Linux OS with std_cache_subsystem. An error address translation result is returned by PTW，which makes the OS crash.\r\n\r\n### Phenomenon\r\nWhen _std_icache_ send address translation requests to MMU continuously，if the following conditions are met：\r\n1. A branch mispredict  occurs in frontend, which will assert _kill_s1_、_kill_s2_ signal \r\n2. FSM of _std_icache_（_state_q_ in std_icache.sv）happens to be inside **TAG_CMP** stage when _kill_s2_=1 \r\n3. The killed request and the following normal request are TBL miss\r\n\r\nIn this situation，MMU receives a back-to-back request and ask PTW to handle them. It seems that MMU treat the back-to-back requests as a single request due to the long process time in PTW. The first request is not killed actually, and the result is returned by MMU as the second request. which will make the Linux OS crash.\r\n\r\n### Detail \r\nwhen _std_icache_ FSM jump to **TAG_CMP**, it asserts _areq_o.fetch_req_ and sends a translation request to MMU: \r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/1b65b8865a505722b8bbbdd1a0e6dc959b28e166/src/cache_subsystem/std_icache.sv#L239\r\nif _kill_s2_ is asserted at this state due to branch mispreditc in frontend:\r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/1b65b8865a505722b8bbbdd1a0e6dc959b28e166/src/frontend/frontend.sv#L244\r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/1b65b8865a505722b8bbbdd1a0e6dc959b28e166/src/frontend/frontend.sv#L247\r\nFSM  in _std_icache_ will jump to **IDLE** to kill this request, but in fact this request has been sent to MMU: \r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/1b65b8865a505722b8bbbdd1a0e6dc959b28e166/src/cache_subsystem/std_icache.sv#L381\r\n\r\nIf the instruction  queue is not empty, _dreq_i.req_ from frontend will keep asserted, FSM in _std_icache_ jumps to **TAG_CMP** again and sends another translation request. MMU receives a back to back request from _std_icache_ like this: \r\n\r\n> _icache_areq_i.fetch_req_ :    XXXX______/¯¯¯\\\\___/¯¯¯\\\\______XXXX\r\n(the first one is the killed request and the second one is a normal request)\r\n\r\nThe killed request makes the FSM in PTW jumping from **IDLE** to **WAIT_GRANT**. As there is no mechanism in PTW to cancel a translation，when the second request come, PTW can not feel it and do something(e.g. update the _ptw_pptr_q_)，it is still in the translation process of the first request. The result of the killed request is returned, which will be treated as the result of the second request by _std_icache_.\r\n\r\nSo the gap is : _std_icache_ kills the first request and sends another request, but PTW does't kill the first one!\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nMaybe **TAG_CMP** can be added in this code to wait PTW exit safely : \r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/1b65b8865a505722b8bbbdd1a0e6dc959b28e166/src/cache_subsystem/std_icache.sv#L381\r\n\r\n###

FSM in cache_ctrl.sv is reseted to IDLE,  miss_req sent to miss_handle is set to 0 \r\n\r\nThe problem is, miss_req is cleared a cycle later after req_port_o.kill_req is set to 1, if FSM in miss_handle happen to be inside IDLE, it will receive the killed miss_req signal, which will affect the following ld instruction and return a error result.\r\n \r\nThe instructions and waveform in this case are as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncopy_process():\r\nffffffe000935b58:   4050b0ef            jal ra,ffffffe00094175c <recalc_sigpending>\r\nffffffe000935b5c:   10016073            csrsi   sstatus,2\r\nffffffe000935b60:   00023d03            ld  s10,0(tp) # 0 <__vdso_rt_sigreturn-0x800>\r\n……\r\nffffffe00094175c <recalc_sigpending>:\r\n…… \r\nffffffe0009417a4:   60f2302f            amoand.d    zero,a5,(tp)\r\nffffffe0009417a8:   00813403            ld  s0,8(sp)\r\nffffffe0009417ac:   01010113            addi    sp,sp,16\r\nffffffe0009417b0:   00008067            ret\r\n```\r\n( the ffffffe0009417a4-amoand.d  is committed, ffffffe000935b60 should be killed, but it is not killed in miss_handle actually, ffffffe0009417a8 will use this error result returned by miss_handle later)\r\n\r\n![std_dcache_miss_handle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68343063/88249200-59ce9580-ccd6-11ea-8154-7f65f490de4d.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn order to solve this problem, I think miss_req should be cleared as soon as req_port_i.kill_req comes,  I add _miss_req_o = '0_ after line 405 in cache_ctrl.sv, it seems that it is ok and Linux can boot succesfully.\r\n```\r\n403 if (req_port_i.kill_req)   begin\r\n404     state_d = IDLE;\r\n405     req_port_o.data_rvalid = 1'b1;   \r\n           miss_req_o = '0\r\n406 end\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/482","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/482/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/482/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/482/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/482","id":665076063,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NjUwNzYwNjM=","number":482,"title":"Do not use global imports of packages in the compilation unit scope unless necessary","user":{"login":"Silabs-ArjanB","id":40633348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjMzMzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40633348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB","html_url":"https://github.com/Silabs-ArjanB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silabs-ArjanB/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-07-24T10:29:22Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T10:40:06Z","closed_at":"2020-08-26T10:40:06Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"The use of global imports of packages (as for example done here https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/c57b275df595601cae85eed6b3b4d47639a6f510/src/ariane.sv#L25) should be avoided.

On CV32E40P all defines were avoided by rewrites performed in https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p/pull/389 (actually the define related to assertions is still there, but will soon be removed as well as assertions will move into seperate files outside of the RTL files). If for some reason defines will still be used, it would be cleaner if they use a uniform prefix (e.g. CVA6_)  to reduce the chance of conflicts with other RTL code.

am seeing an issue where `instruction_o.pc` will unexpectedly be set to 0 after `is_mispredict` is triggered.

After `is_mispredict` is triggered, in `frontend.sv`, `npc_d` is set to `resolved_branch_i.target_address`, which is 0, which eventually causes `instruction_o.pc` to be set to 0.

My feeling is that DTM must be modified to support XLEN=32. \r\n\r\nWhen debug is activated and XLEN=32, I get an exception. During the negotiation phase, the SimDTM module challenges the DTM to know which is the size of the microprocessor. First SimDTM command tries to ask for 128bits transaction, second command asks for 64bits. If the two commands are not supported, SimDTM understands it is 32bits.\r\n\r\nThe first debug command received by DTM is: 0x00421008, size=3’b100 (128bits)\r\n  The DTM answers with  \r\n0x0000000000000300 ebreak \r\n because the 128bits is not supported\r\n\r\nThe second command received is : 0x00321008, size=3’b011 (64bits)\r\n  The DTM answer with the following sequence of instructions\r\n0x0000000000000300  j       pc + 0x38\r\n0x0000000000000338  csrw    unknown_7b3, a0\r\n0x000000000000033c  auipc   a0, 0x0\r\n0x0000000000000340  srli    a0, a0, 12\r\n0x0000000000000344  slli    a0, a0, 12\r\n0x0000000000000348  sd      s0, 896(a0)\r\nAs sd is not implemented in rv32, exception occurs\r\n\r\nTo my mind the second command should not be supported by DTM and DTM should be modified.

noticed an issue with the `axi_node_intf_wrap` module instantiated as `i_axi_xbar`in the verilator model `ariane_testharness.sv`.\r\nI expanded the axi user port in the `.axi_req_o ( axi_ariane_req      ),` signal coming from the ariane module to 134 bits to send additional information to one of the axi modules as part of the AW and AR bus. I also updated the `src/util/axi_*.sv` files to not set the user signals to 0.\r\nHowever, it turns out the signal isn't propagated properly for the AR bus, whereas it is working mostly fine for AW.\r\nI traced the signals and it seems that the culprit is the `i_axi_xbar instance` of `axi_node_intf_wrap`.\r\nThe screenshot shows the axi signals coming from the ariane module and entering the slave interface of the i_axi_xbar instance and the output of the 9 master interfaces.

This module is connected as master on the interconnect in the same way that the Ariane core is connected (using a `req_t` and `resp_t` connected to an `axi_master_connect`).\r\n\r\nWhen trying to read a DRAM address, a response never arrives (`r_valid` never becomes high). I assumed the problem was in my test module, but when I change the address to one inside the bootrom instead of the DRAM, the response arrives correctly. To further inspect the issue, I have added debug probes to the AXI signals of both my own module and the DRAM. This results in the following waveforms:\r\n\r\nRequest in the test module:\r\n![axi_req](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9934566/101696829-ff608680-3a76-11eb-8daf-3f05a1c65c07.png)\r\n\r\nRequest to the DRAM:\r\n![axi_req_dram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9934566/101696946-39318d00-3a77-11eb-83a2-28715466928f.png)\r\n\r\nResponse from the DRAM:\r\n![axi_resp_dram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9934566/101696993-4b133000-3a77-11eb-8905-16bc0d8e1254.png)\r\n\r\nSo the request arrives correctly at the DRAM, and the response is correctly returned to the interconnect. However, this result never propagates back to the test module.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/568/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/569","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/569/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/569/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/569/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/569","id":761147216,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NjExNDcyMTY=","number":569,"title":"Debugging with Verilator, OpenOCD and GDB","user":{"login":"abdullahyildiz","id":3716793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTY3OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3716793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz","html_url":"https://github.com/abdullahyildiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahyildiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-12-10T11:13:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T12:52:54Z","closed_at":"2020-12-10T12:52:53Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I'm trying to connect to Verilator simulation from GDB.

Coremark is okay (> 2 Coremark/Mhz).\r\n\r\nI'm happy for suggestions, thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/580/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/583","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/583/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/583/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/583/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/583","id":787897209,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3ODc4OTcyMDk=","number":583,"title":"Make verilator: can't find \"ariane_testharness__DOT__i_sram__DOT__genblk1__BRA__0__KET____DOT__genblk2__DOT__i_ram__DOT__Mem_DP\"","user":{"login":"sczh01","id":287193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzE5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/287193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01","html_url":"https://github.com/sczh01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sczh01/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-01-18T04:05:56Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T13:08:07Z","closed_at":"2021-01-18T13:08:07Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"issue description:\r\n1.\r\nWhen I build \"make verilator\", I can't find below define in file ./tb/ariane_tb.cpp.\r\n\"ariane_testharness__DOT__i_sram__DOT__genblk1__BRA__0__KET____DOT__genblk2__DOT__i_ram__DOT__Mem_DP\"\r\n\r\nI also search the code in all project, also not find it.

Once that is done, Which BTW has issues in terms of accurately describing how to use and assumes things it should not, then you end up with tools installed at `$INSTALL_DIR`, which you then have to reset your `$RISCV` to point to, and then things like `$RISCV/bin/riscv-none-elf-gcc` etc are available.

Should I include those cycles spent in Debug Mode?\r\n- How is the memory (DRAM, L1D, L1I) accesses modeled? \r\n  It is mentioned [here](https://cva6.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html?highlight=Two%20cycle%20memory%20access#scope-and-purpose) that the data cache (or DRAM) has a latency of 1 cycle whereas the instruction cache has a 3-cycle latency; however, I could not locate these parameters in the repository, can you please tell me where they are if they are parametrizable?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\nBest

Dr. Zaruba and project contributors,\r\n\r\nI am in the process of simulating Ariane with the Linux image mounted on it, in QuestaSim. From what I see in previous threads [[1]](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/6#issuecomment-367030272) [[2]](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/314) this is possible.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of questions that I would greatly appreciate if someone can help me with:\r\n\r\na) You are mentioning a time of ~1.5 days [[3]](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/42) in order to mount the image in simulation. Is this time with preloading or not? From what I have seen, there is an option to preload the Linux image in the memory. Is `make sim preload=vmlinux` the correct command to preload the Linux image in the memory and simulate it (vmlinux image being inside the `./cva6` folder)? \r\n\r\nb) What do I expect to see inside the `transcript` file that is generated? Do I expect to see all the booting sequence that I witness when booting in Linux using the FPGA? \r\nUntil now, I have run the above mentioned command and I got the following inside the `transcript` file after ~2 days of running:\r\n```\r\n# ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n# UVM-1.1d\r\n# (C) 2007-2013 Mentor Graphics Corporation\r\n# (C) 2007-2013 Cadence

such a simulation at a post-synthesis/post-implementation stage or is it only possible with the pre-synthesis RTL?\r\n\r\nd) Is it possible in simulation to run a simple C program when the Linux image has completely booted?\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate any response on the above questions as it is the first time trying to go through such a complex simulation mechanism.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your responses and time!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nNassos","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/651","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/651/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/651/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/651/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/651","id":856990077,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4NTY5OTAwNzc=","number":651,"title":"Empty

the user process accessed the kernel space address `0xffffffd00400b400`, which caused the kernel to crash with an error code `0xf` that corresponds to a `STORE_PAGE_FAULT`. It is obvious that a user process should not have access to the kernel address space, however from my knowledge I was expecting for the program/user process to crash instead of the whole kernel.\r\n\r\nCan I safely assume that this behavior is attributed to the Linux image and is the expected?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your responses and time.\r\n\r\nKind

https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/485662f0c9a315e084c5e18db49b4ea4a7503dfe/src/cache_subsystem/cache_ctrl.sv#L258-L268\r\nFrom my understanding both the load-unit and the ptw will always send a tag-valid in the next clock cycle after receiving data_gnt from the cache_ctrl. So how can the cache_ctrl possibly ever enter WAIT_GNT?\r\nOnly situation I can imagine, is if the load-unit got an exception when receiving the data_gnt, \r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/485662f0c9a315e084c5e18db49b4ea4a7503dfe/src/load_unit.sv#L244-L247\r\nbut then the load-cache_ctrl will be stuck in WAIT_GNT/WAIT_TAG, as there is no way the load-unit can receive another data_gnt while the cache_ctrl is waiting for a tag_valid and therefore will never issue a tag_valid... Sounds like a deadlock to me.\r\n\r\nI am guessing this is related to issue #430 \r\nI am grateful for any help regarding the understanding of this design.\r\nThank you in advance.</div>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/691/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/692","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/692/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/692/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/692/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/692","id":939480208,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5Mzk0ODAyMDg=","number":692,"title":"Worrisome license","user":{"login":"taylor-bsg","id":17460864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDYwODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17460864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg","html_url":"https://github.com/taylor-bsg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylor-bsg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-07-08T05:19:02Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T12:36:09Z","closed_at":"2021-07-20T12:36:09Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/caf18728375538fe7cf65d8146f5abd5a9c293a9/src/re_name.sv#L11","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/696","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/696/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/696/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/696/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/696","id":948500727,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NDg1MDA3Mjc=","number":696,"title":"Field_name and its description while updating contain of the cva632a6_csr_template.yml and cva64a6_csr_template.yml","user":{"login":"RanjanThales","id":80903295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTAzMjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80903295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales","html_url":"https://github.com/RanjanThales","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RanjanThales/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2021-07-20T10:06:08Z","updated_at":"2021-09-22T19:01:17Z","closed_at":"2021-09-22T19:01:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi Team,\r\n\r\nWhile updating contain of the cva632a6_csr_template.yml and cva64a6_csr_template.yml, I couldn't find details on the field_name and its description. i.e. \r\n\r\n- csr: CSR_FFLAGS\r\n  description: >\r\n    Floating point Accrued Exceptions\r\n  address: 0x001\r\n  privilege_mode: U\r\n  rv32:\r\n    -

have already attached an AXI Slave component on the AXI Crossbar, and communicated to it from the OS through the Kernel Driver. For this purpose, I assigned an address let's say 0x5000_0000 to this AXI Slave IP. \r\n\r\nMy problem now is that If I want to connect several AXI Slaves (as part of another module) (for example 8 AXI Slave Slaves) on the AXI Cross bar which is the best solution? The easiest and probably not professional way is that to extend number of slave ports of the AXI Crossbar. But, since I am a perfectionism, I intend to extend the AXI Crossbar with just one AXI Slave port, then re-construct the AXI Slave Components on it through an \"AXI DMUX\". \r\n\r\nPROBLEM: Since in the ariane_soc_pkg.sv I have only one extended slave base address, how the Kernel Driver distinguishes the AXI Slave ports of the AXI DMUX? (The setup is as follows):\r\n\r\n \r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38837310/144589991-de119896-bdc3-4972-8bd7-768b791ad376.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn the above figure the bottom path (IP1), consider user software wants to communicate to the AXI Slave port with address 0x5000_000. Since this address is set into the ariane.dts, and is mmaped by the Kernel Driver, it can be easily recognized by the system. However, I am not confident (have not the knowledge) that how to use AXI DMUX and distinguish connected Slave Components from the user software (also in ariane.dts). \r\n\r\nI eagerly look forward in someone who has the key of this question!

Therefore we are checking if a user-level process sets the PC to the correct address when a trap to machine or supervisor mode is executed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the RISCV-ISA (Document Version 20211203) section 3.1.7 (page 29) and 4.1.2 (page 66) the *mtvec* and *stvec* registers specify  how the corresponding address is calculated. Both registers consist of a BASE-field and a MODE-field. The MODE for *mtvec* and *stvec* can be set independently from each other to either *direct* or *vectored*. That means upon a trap to machine mode \r\n- PC is set to BASE of *mtvec* if the MODE of *mtvec* is *direct* \r\n- PC is set to BASE + 4 * cause if MODE is *vectored* and it is an interrupt. \r\n\r\nSimilarly traps into supervisor mode are handled according to the settings of BASE and MODE in *stvec*.\r\n\r\nWhen formally verifying this behavior on CVA6 we get a counterexample showing a behavior that does not comply with the ISA: A user-level process executes an interrupt and sets the PC to BASE + 4 * cause. However, the MODE of *mtvec* is set to *direct*.\r\n\r\nThe reason for that can be found in lines 981-998 or more precisely in line 996 of the csr_regfile.sv: \r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/e748564dd880d68a9b0bde7e1a92c48c75823391/core/csr_regfile.sv#L981-L998\r\nWhenever **one** MODE, the MODE of *mtvec* or the MODE of *stvec*, is set to *vectored* and it is an interrupt, the address calculation for the PC is done in *vectored* mode. Is this a bug or am I missing something here?\r\n\r\nThanks and best regards,\r\nAnna","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/793","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/793/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/793/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/793/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/793","id":1106138130,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085B7lQS","number":793,"title":"Adding benchmarks","user":{"login":"imadassir","id":41484960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDg0OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41484960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir","html_url":"https://github.com/imadassir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadassir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2205679082,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA1Njc5MDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Component:Tool-and-build","name":"Component:Tool-and-build","color":"68fc46","default":false,"description":"For issues in the tool and build flow (e.g. Makefile, FuseSoc, etc.)"},{"id":2205679187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA1Njc5MTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Type:Question","name":"Type:Question","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":"For general questions"},{"id":5128020216,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBxJ9088AAAABMadg-A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Status:In%20Progress","name":"Status:In Progress","color":"a19ff2","default":false,"description":"Work on this issue has started, but is not complete."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ASintzoff","id":61976467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTc2NDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61976467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff","html_url":"https://github.com/ASintzoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ASintzoff","id":61976467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTc2NDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61976467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff","html_url":"https://github.com/ASintzoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASintzoff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2022-01-17T18:06:50Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T10:37:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello,\r\nAs part of a personal project, I am working on adding a prefetcher for CVA6.

am new to OpenOCD and debugging through FPGA emulation. So, pardon if any of the following seem trivial. \r\n\r\nI am using the Digilent 2 board for emulation purposes. I built my openocd from riscv-openocd fork. I have a working Linux OS installed on my target. I followed the instructions provided on readme to open a terminal for OpenOCD using:\r\n`openocd -f ariane.cfg`\r\nThis seems to be working fine with the output log being:\r\n\r\n```\r\n`Open On-Chip Debugger 0.11.0+dev-02217-g52ca5d198 (2022-01-31-13:19)\r\nLicensed under GNU GPL v2\r\nFor bug reports, read\r\n\thttp://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html\r\nnone separate\r\n\r\nDEPRECATED! use 'adapter speed' not 'adapter_khz'\r\nDEPRECATED! use 'adapter driver' not 'interface'\r\nWarn : Interface already configured, ignoring\r\nDEPRECATED! use 'ftdi vid_pid' not 'ftdi_vid_pid'\r\nDEPRECATED! use 'ftdi channel' not 'ftdi_channel'\r\nDEPRECATED! use 'ftdi layout_init' not 'ftdi_layout_init'\r\nDEPRECATED! use 'ftdi layout_signal' not 'ftdi_layout_signal'\r\nInfo : auto-selecting first available session transport \"jtag\".

I generated the .elf file of a simple Hello World program by compiling with the the riscv64-unknonw-elf-gcc. Then I established connection with the remote host. This is probably where the problem starts as I can see there's some packet error encountered although I am not sure why.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\r\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\r\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\r\nType \"show copying\" and \"show warranty\" for details.\r\nThis GDB was configured as \"--host=x86_64-linux-gnu --target=riscv64-unknown-elf\".\r\nType \"show configuration\" for configuration details.\r\nFor bug reporting instructions, please see:\r\n<https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/issues>.\r\nFind the GDB manual and other documentation resources online at:\r\n    <http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/>.\r\n\r\nFor help, type \"help\".\r\nType \"apropos word\" to search for commands related to \"word\"...\r\nReading symbols from /home/hasan/Desktop/hello.elf...\r\n(gdb) target remote localhost:3333\r\nRemote debugging using localhost:3333\r\n0xffffffe0006930e4 in ?? ()\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\n```\r\nNext, I load the program using `load`. However, I see that the program is starting loading into the address 0x100b0 which I believe should not be the case (it should start at 0x800000). But it still loads the program successfully:\r\n```\r\n(gdb) load\r\nLoading section .text, size 0x260c lma 0x100b0\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nLoading section .rodata, size 0x18 lma 0x126c0\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nLoading section .eh_frame, size 0x4 lma 0x136d8\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nLoading section .init_array, size 0x10 lma 0x136e0\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nLoading section .fini_array, size 0x8 lma 0x136f0\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nLoading section .data, size 0xf58 lma 0x136f8\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nLoading section .sdata, size 0x40 lma 0x14650\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nStart address 0x100c6, load size 13784\r\nIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nTransfer rate: 286 bytes/sec, 1969 bytes/write.\r\n```\r\nMeanwhile, I get this error message on the first terminal:\r\n```\r\nError: Timed out after 120s waiting for busy to go low (abstractcs=0x8001002). Increase the timeout with riscv set_command_timeout_sec.\r\nError: Abstract command ended in error 'busy' (abstractcs=0x8001102)\r\nError: Timed out after 120s waiting for busy to go low (abstractcs=0x8001102).

Increase the timeout with riscv set_command_timeout_sec.\r\nError: Unsupported register (enum gdb_regno)(8)\r\n```\r\nI have tried to set the timeout from telnet using `riscv set_command_timeout_sec 300`. This time I did not get the unsupported register or timeout errors on the OpenOCD terminal (it still shows packet error on gdb terminal though).  \r\n\r\nAfter the program is loaded, when I try to single step through the program using `si` it gets stuck at \"Ignoring packet error, continuing\" and nothing shows up. I also tried to read memory addresses using \r\n```\r\n(gdb) x/i 0x100b0\r\n   0x100b0 <register_fini>:\tIgnoring packet error, continuing...\r\nReply contains invalid hex digit 116\r\n```\r\nThis same error message (Reply contains invalid hex digit) shows up for other memory addresses as well.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong? To the best of my understanding, the problem lies with the elf file loading since it's loading at address 0x100b0 instead of 0x80000. Is there a different process for generating the elf file in FPGA emulation other than the process I followed? Also, why do I get these other errors? How do I get rid of them? Any help is much appreciated, thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/810/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/811","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/811/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/811/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/811/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/811","id":1123862809,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085C_MkZ","number":811,"title":"no

All,\r\nI have a question regarding the handling of the ECALL instruction (32h73): In the rvfi_tracer this instruction leads to the direct finish of the simulation (https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/master/corev_apu/tb/rvfi_tracer.sv#L60). Can you explain why this is the case? Is this just not handled at this point in time?\r\nI am currently using a little bit older commit (44a89b9cd408b869fb4ed2c0cec35e1561588e37), as the later ones result in the issue raised in #800. Running `make run-asm-tests` will run the rv64ui-v-addi test which results in the test not passing (no \"SUCCESS\" is being printed).\r\nI raise this issue, as one can comment out the finish statements in the tracer and the program finishes correctly. However, a synthesized version of the core will get stuck at this instruction. The synthesized core I have will run the benchmarks and other compiled programs (and most isa tests) correctly, but some of them exhibit this problem.\r\n\r\nI would be really happy to hear back from you\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nChristian\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/836/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/836/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/837","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/837/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/837/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/837/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/837","id":1166318074,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085FhJn6","number":837,"title":"fpu_valid_o in issue_stage.sv","user":{"login":"misomochi","id":35426138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI2MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35426138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi","html_url":"https://github.com/misomochi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misomochi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2022-03-11T11:39:37Z","updated_at":"2022-03-13T05:37:37Z","closed_at":"2022-03-13T05:37:37Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I was learning about how Fpnew is integrated into the Ariane core and wanted to make sure how its handshake interface (ready/valid protocol) is being dealt with.

I try to implement the [meltdown attack](https://meltdownattack.com) on CVA6 but I have some problems.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the [meltdown attack](https://meltdownattack.com) is to try to use the load instruction to access data with illegal permissions, and to leak the data through a cache-based side channel. Therefore, we must find a way to delay the processing of exceptions so that there is time to leak data with illegal permissions.\r\n\r\nAccording to the document of CVA6, the architecture of CVA6 is in-order issue, OoO write back and in-order commit. And CVA6 only handles exceptions in the commit stage. So I think this architecture may have the opportunity to be threatened by [meltdown attack](https://meltdownattack.com).\r\n\r\nBelow is the simple assembly code segment I am trying to execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfdiv.s fa6, fa4, fa5                             // to delay the commit of the exception.\r\nld s1, 0(s1)                                     // load data with illegal permissions (will cause the exception)\r\nadd s3, s2, s1                                 \r\nld s2, 0(s3)                                     // leakage the data by cache based side channel\r\n```\r\nSince the execution time of the `fdiv.s` instruction is not long enough, the exception is committed first before the data is successfully leaked. I try to use other instructions like `div` to delay the commit of the exception, but the `add` instruction will not be issued by issue unit because the execution unit is occupied by `div` as shown below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nalways_comb begin : unit_busy\r\n        unique case (issue_instr_i.fu)\r\n            NONE:\r\n                fu_busy = 1'b0;\r\n            ALU, CTRL_FLOW, CSR, MULT:\r\n                fu_busy = ~flu_ready_i;\r\n            FPU, FPU_VEC:\r\n                fu_busy = ~fpu_ready_i;\r\n            LOAD, STORE:\r\n                fu_busy = ~lsu_ready_i;\r\n            CVXIF:\r\n                fu_busy = ~cvxif_ready_i;\r\n            default:\r\n                fu_busy = 1'b0;\r\n        endcase\r\n    end\r\n```\r\nIs there any other instruction whose execution time is longer than `fdiv.s`, and will not conflict with the resources of the `add` instruction and the `load`instruction ? Or are there other reasons why the CVA6 is not at risk from a meltdown attack?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/852","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/852/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/852/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/852/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/852","id":1199074855,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085HeG4n","number":852,"title":"interrupt nesting","user":{"login":"LangQingjie","id":53026467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDI2NDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53026467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie","html_url":"https://github.com/LangQingjie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LangQingjie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2205678651,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA1Njc4NjUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Component:Doc","name":"Component:Doc","color":"68fc46","default":false,"description":"For issues in the Documentation (e.g. for README.md files)"},{"id":2205679125,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA1Njc5MTI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Status:Resolved","name":"Status:Resolved","color":"a19ff2","default":false,"description":"Issue has been resolved, but closure is pending on git merge and/or issuer confirmation"},{"id":2205679187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA1Njc5MTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Type:Question","name":"Type:Question","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":"For general questions"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2022-04-10T15:30:09Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T02:04:45Z","closed_at":"2023-02-17T02:04:44Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello, I was reading the source code of cva6 recently, but I was a little confused about the implementation of interrupt nesting.

a completly beginner on this world and my knowledge about it its very poor because I'm still studying the degree so sry if my questions are \"simple\".\r\nFrom now the only thing that I want to do its to verify the cva6 core, Im following the next steps to do it:\r\n**1- obviously first thing its to get the core:**\r\ngit clone https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6.git\r\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\r\n**2- get the tools so Im able to compile the core:**\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tools\r\n$ cd riscv-tools\r\n$ git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n$ export RISCV=\r\n$ export PATH=${PATH}:${RISCV}/bin\r\n$ ./build.sh\r\n**3- Have all neccesary to work (my case RHEL)**\r\n$ sudo yum install autoconf automake git libmpc-devel mpfr-devel gmp-devel gawk bison flex texinfo gcc gcc-c++ zlib-devel\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n\r\n1. to verify the module with questasim what should I follow in terms of help to do it, because all I see its verilator and UVM but what I need its to use the test that are on the repository and simulate them with questasim.\r\n2. Is necessary to build all the tools as I did to just verify the core?, because when I make the comand $ ./build.sh it generate an error that says that my version of automake isnt 1.14 or superior but actually I got the version 1.14 of automake so how can I fix this error or if I can find another way to just build the tools that I need to verify the module.\r\nSry again if my question could be \"stupid\" I have just to verify the module and supposedly I have everything I need to do this job.\r\nThanks a lot, anything could

interested in bypassing the cache subsystem ([the data cache](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/master/core/cache_subsystem/wt_dcache.sv)) in an effort to communicate between the CPU and the main memory directly. However, I'm running into issues regarding the physical addressing between the two.\r\n\r\nI'm having real difficulty understanding how the lower order bits of the CPU request's physical address need to be converted before being sent out to the AXI adapter (with the existing cache subsystem). I've collected instruction trace information of the CVA6 running a benchmark program, grouping the memory request type, the request from the [Load/Store unit](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/master/core/load_store_unit.sv), and the input to the AXI adapter (memory request). I can't make heads or tails of why (and how) the lower 4 bits change:\r\n\r\n**request #, request type, cpu request physical address, memory request physical address**\r\n_1,  sb, 800290bf   (...1111), 800290bf  (...1111)\r\n2,    sb, 800290be  (...1110), 800290bd (...1101)\r\n3,    sb, 800290bd  (...1101), 800290bb (...1011)\r\n4,    sb, 800290bc  (...1100), 800290bc  (...1100)\r\n5,    sb, 800290bb  (...1011), 800290b7 (...0111)\r\n6,    sb, 800290ba  (...1010), 800290b8 (...1000)\r\n7,    sb, 800290b9  (...1001), 800290be (...1110)\r\n8,    sb, 800290b8  (...1000), 800290b4 (...0100)\r\n9,    sb, 800290b7  (...0111), 800290b9 (...1001)\r\n10, sb, 800290b6   (...0110), 800290b5 (...0101)\r\n11, sb, 800290b5   (...0101), 800290ba (...1010)\r\n12, sb, 800290b4   (...0100), 800290b6 (...0110)_\r\n.. \r\n\r\nI think my confusion comes from not really understanding the byte addressing format of the CPU/AXI protocol. I've thought through many possibilities but am still unable to spot the pattern or the rationale behind the input/output addresses. \r\n\r\nI've tried going through CVA6's source code, investigating where the memory request physical addresses are generated or used to better understand the data transactions. For example, [here](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/master/core/cache_subsystem/wt_axi_adapter.sv#L142), where depending on the 3rd bit of the memory request's physical address, we rearrange the 32 bit data coming from the LSU. Or [here](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/master/core/cache_subsystem/wt_axi_adapter.sv#L185), where it seems that the last 3 bits of the physical address correspond to a write byte enable for the 64 bit AXI bus. Or [here](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/master/core/cache_subsystem/wt_dcache_wbuffer.sv#L178) where the write buffer sets the _paddr_ bits... that last one seemed promising, so I followed the _wbuffer_dirty_mux.wtag_ and _bdirty_off_ signals down the rabbit hole, but their assignment was a bit hard to follow as they are connected to the Round Robin arbiter and also a leading zero counter, which are connected to other signals, and so on...\r\n\r\nI've attached a simulation result which illustrates the above store requests. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, I'd really appreciate some guidance on how the physical addresses need to be set in order to properly bypass the cache. I'm getting rather lost within the code. Thank you so much!

Truncating pc will make it much less difficult for an attacker to launch an attack using memory corruption vulnerabilities, like the [bug](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-ios-hacker-tries-android.html) mentioned by google's team.\r\n> The consequence of using an unaligned addition like this is that we've also corrupted the value of X1, which stores the userspace address from which to copy in the data. Instead of the upper bytes being all 0, the top byte is now nonzero. Quite fortunately, however, this isn't a problem because the kernel was compiled with support for the Top Byte Ignore (TBI) architectural feature enabled for userspace, which means that the top byte of the pointer will be ignored for the purpose of address translation by the CPU.\r\n\r\nThe truncated mechanism implicitly implements a mechanism similar to TBI, which means that an attacker only needs to modify 56 bytes to be able to tamper with the control flow of the program, and the specification also suggests:\r\n> Ordinarily, if an instruction attempts to access memory at an inaccessible address, an exception is raised for the instruction. Vacant locations in the address space are never accessible.\r\n\r\n[cva6-5.zip](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/8834336/cva6-5.zip)\r\n\r\n> @LuminaDCIX helps reproduce the

all,\r\nI am trying to develop an Ethernet driver for u-Boot on a Genesys2 using as a starting point the lowRISC Ethernet driver for Linux, but I have encountered an odd behavior with the controller where most of the times the received frames contains only garbage.\r\nWhilst this might seem like a cache problem, disabling it is of no avail; furthermore, the frame content is not just \"random\" data, but it is instead an 8-byte pattern repeated for the size of the received frame.\r\n\r\nCurrently the driver is set to use 8 buffers. By looking at the RSR register each time I get a frame, I have observed an interesting behavior: assuming a value of 18XY, for y=0 or y=1 the frame is correct; else the frame contains garbage. X is indifferent.\r\n\r\nAs an example, this is what I observe:\r\ngood example:\r\n```\r\nSRS value is 1821 (or 1810)\r\n[lowrisc eth: recv] \r\n0018 3e02 e37f [...] (frame is valid)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbad example:\r\n```\r\nSRS value is 18fe\r\n[lowrisc eth: recv]\r\n0000 0000 2867 5464 0000 0000 2867 2664 \r\n0000 0604 2867 2664 0000 0000 2867 [...] (frame is invalid)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I change the number of buffers to 2 (changing address offset calculation accordingly) I can see that frames at first aren't correct, then it mostly receives correct data:\r\n```\r\nSRS value is 12[10, 0f, fe, ed, dc, cb, ba, 98] (frame is invalid)\r\nSRS value is 12[87, 76, 65, 54, 43, 32, 31, (10?)] (frame is valid)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy dumping the memory that the Ethernet controller uses from u-Boot I can confirm this too is not a copying issue from the driver side, as the data shown matches the data I retreive. \r\nAddresses are always 64-bit aligned too. Network is point to point and therefore there is no external traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the defconfig for u-Boot I have added the following configurations:\r\n```\r\nCONFIG_DEFAULT_DEVICE_TREE=\"cv64a6_genesysII\"\r\nCONFIG_LOWRISC_ETH=y\r\nCONFIG_SYS_DCACHE_OFF=y\r\nCONFIG_SPL_SYS_DCACHE_OFF=y\r\nCONFIG_64BIT=y\t\t\t#unaffecting\r\nCONFIG_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT=y\t#default for the previous, but better be safe than sorry...\r\nCONFIG_PHY_REALTEK=y\t\t#the Genesys2 is using a Realtek 8211E PHY\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt boot time, this is what u-Boot tells regarding the Ethernet Controller:\r\n```\r\nclk_set_defaults(lowrisc-eth@30000000)\r\nclk_set_default_parents: could not read assigned-clock-parents for 00000000bf761800\r\nofnode_read_prop: assigned-clock-rates: <not found>\r\nofnode_read_prop: tick-timer: <not found>\r\nLowrisc PHY read: addr = 1, reg = 2, out = 0x1c\r\nLowrisc PHY read: addr = 1, reg = 3, out = 0xc915\r\nLowrisc PHY write: addr = 1, reg = 0, val = 0x8000\r\nLowrisc PHY read: addr = 1, reg = 0, out = 0x1140\r\nlowrisc-eth@30000000 connected to RealTek RTL8211E\r\nLowrisc PHY write: addr = 1, reg = 0, val = 0x8000\r\nLowrisc PHY write: addr = 1, reg = 18, val = 0x0\r\nLowrisc PHY read: addr = 1, reg = 18, out = 0x0\r\nLowrisc PHY write: addr = 1, reg = 0, val = 0x200\r\nget_prop_check_min_len: mac-address\r\nget_prop_check_min_len: local-mac-address\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy assumption therefore is that there is an issue with the Ethernet controller, but I might be missing something. Do you have any possible idea of what could be going

bug was initially reported in #708.\r\n\r\n> Consider the following scenario while executing from nonidempotent memory:\r\n> \r\n> 1. A branch instruction is fetched => `speculative_d = 1'b1`\r\n> 2. The instruction queue is full, `replay` is asserted\r\n> 3. Once the instruction queue is `ready` again, the frontend sends a request to the icache to refetch the branch instruction\r\n> 4. The icache blocks as `dreq.spec == 1'b1` (and we do not fetch speculatively from nonidempotent memory)\r\n> 5. Deadlock\r\n\r\nI think there are several possible ways to handle this, for instance:\r\n- Clear the `speculative` register on a replay (proposed in #708)\r\n- Disallow execution from NI memory (is this RISC-V compliant? Are there cases for executing from NI memory, e.g. the debug module?)\r\n_Note: for the debug module, it might suffice to define only writes as non-idempotent and reads (including instruction fetches) as idempotent, which is possible according to the priv. spec but currently not supported by ariane._\r\n- Allow speculative instruction fetches from NI memory, possibly violating the NI requirement\r\n- Preventing replays in the first place when executing from NI memory, i.e. only fetching when the instruction queue can certainly accept an incoming instruction. For NI memory, we generally do not care about performance, and this might be the cleanest solution allowing to execute from NI memory without side effects.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help implement one of the solutions above (or yet another)!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/927/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/931","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/931/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/931/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/931/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/931","id":1296275833,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085NQ5l5","number":931,"title":"[BUG] make verilate fails with undefined reference to `Verilated::s_ns' errors","user":{"login":"mik1234mc","id":24656413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjU2NDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24656413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc","html_url":"https://github.com/mik1234mc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik1234mc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2205679159,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA1Njc5MTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Type:Bug","name":"Type:Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":"For bugs in the RTL, Documentation, Verification environment or Tool and Build system"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2022-07-06T19:25:25Z","updated_at":"2023-02-07T20:19:27Z","closed_at":"2023-02-07T20:19:27Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\nHi all,\r\n\r\nif I run `make verilate`, it fails with multiple of `undefined reference to 'Verilated::s_ns` errors and one `undefined reference to 'Verilated::commandArgs(int, char const**)'`.

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\r\n\r\n### Bug Description\r\n\r\nIssue identified when validating PR #945 by means of unit tests introduced in https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/pull/1392:\r\n* Test of instruction `C.FLD` on RV64GC passes (RTL traces from VCS and Verilator match the Spike trace)\r\n* Test of instruction `C.FLW` on RV32IMAFC fails:\r\n  * Both RTL traces (from VCS and from Verilator) differ from the Spike trace\r\n  * The two RTL traces are identical.\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n* The RTL execution hits an illegal instruction exception at the PC of instruction `C.FLW  fs0, 0(s1)`\r\n* The RTL execution log contains incorrent disassembly (see PR https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/pull/1418) but the RTL control flow **does** match the Spike-side all the way up to the exception.\r\n* waveform analysis points to the instruction decoder (`core/decoder.sv`) which raises the `ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION` exception upon detecting a request to perform a 64b FP load in the decompressed instruction.\r\n\r\n## Root cause\r\n* The compressed instruction sets of RV32C and RV64C differ on several instructions in all three compressed quadrants.\r\n* The compressed decoder handles the differences in instruction meaning in quadrant 1 (`opcode[1:0] == 2'b01`) of the compressed instruction space, but not in quadrant 0 (`opcode[1:0] == 2'b00`) nor quadrant 2 (`opcode[1:0] == 2'b10`).\r\n\r\n## Proposed fix\r\nRewrite the \"dual-personality\" entries of the compressed decoder so that they apply the correct decompression scheme according to the current XLEN.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/956/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/960","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/960/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/960/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/960/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/960","id":1380801831,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085STV0n","number":960,"title":"Unable

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nI would like to increase the base frequency of the CVA6 core from 50MHz to

seems pretty big considering the small change in the frequency.\r\n\r\nI have seen in a previous question [here](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/389), that it is possible to increase the base frequency if I adjust the base frequency in the bootloader and the device tree.\r\n\r\nSome questions:\r\n\r\n1) which device tree should I adjust, the `cv64a6.dts` or the `ariane.dts`?\r\n2) in which file do I change the base frequency of the bootloader?\r\n3) are the above files used during Synthesis/Implementation and if so, are they sufficient to resolve my issue?\r\n\r\nI am using a Genesys-2 board and Vivado v19.2.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help and time!\r\n\r\nKind

We have been started the installation on our virtual machine (Debian version 11.5.0). We have followed the \"getting started instructions\":\r\n\r\nwe made the **Checkout Repo**\r\n\r\nthen we have **installed the toolchain risv-gnu-toolchain**\r\n\r\nand we have started to **Install Verilator Simulation Flow**\r\n-->export RISCV=/opt/riscv\r\n-->./ci/setup.sh --> I have verifying that ventilator has been correctly installed (it is the version 4.110)\r\n\r\nAnd when we enter the instruction **make verilate**  it happens this: the VM start to run instructions and at a point it crashed and after a while the VM just restart. --> That's why I was not able to catch all instruction and paste it there but I have attached a picture of the screen when the VM crashed.\r\n<img width=\"810\" alt=\"Capture d’écran 2022-10-17 à 10 22 38\"

for Questasim is broken. It complains about packages not being defined. This is due to the `Flist.$(target)` being compiled last instead of first, which contains the files for the necessary package definitions.\r\nAdditionally, the path for the Flist has been copy/pasted from the VCS simulation setup, but that one starts in a different folder.\r\nBelow is a patch to fix this as I do not have a simple way to open a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git

Before this commit, we get the expected output, but after this, an invalid instruction is read and the following error gets displayed:\r\n```\r\n# [TRACER] Output filename is: trace_hart_0.log\r\n# [UART]: bbl loader\r\n#                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n# ** Warning:           1[l1 dcache] reading invalid instructions: vaddr=800044c0, data=xxxxxxxx\r\n#    Time: 56631630 ns Started: 56631630 ns  Scope: ariane_tb.dut.i_ariane.i_cva6.i_cache_subsystem.a_invalid_instruction_fetch File: /home/lanius/code/cva6/cva6/core/cache_subsystem/wt_cache_subsystem.sv Line: 176\r\n# ** Warning:           1[l1 dcache] reading invalid instructions: vaddr=000100c8, data=xxxxxxxx\r\n#    Time: 57343150 ns Started: 57343150 ns  Scope: ariane_tb.dut.i_ariane.i_cva6.i_cache_subsystem.a_invalid_instruction_fetch File: /home/lanius/code/cva6/cva6/core/cache_subsystem/wt_cache_subsystem.sv Line: 176\r\n# z  0000000000000000 ra 0000000000000000 sp 0000003ffffffb30 gp 0000000000000000\r\n# tp 0000000000000000 t0 0000000000000000 t1 0000000000000000 t2 0000000000000000\r\n# s0 0000000000000000 s1 0000000000000000 a0 0000000000000000 a1 0000000000000000\r\n# a2 0000000000000000 a3 0000000000000000 a4 0000000000000000 a5 0000000000000000\r\n# a6 0000000000000000 a7 0000000000000000 s2 0000000000000000 s3 0000000000000000\r\n# s4 0000000000000000 s5 0000000000000000 s6 0000000000000000 s7 0000000000000000\r\n# s8 0000000000000000 s9 0000000000000000 sA 0000000000000000 sB 0000000000000000\r\n# t3 0000000000000000 t4 0000000000000000 t5 0000000000000000 t6 0000000000000000\r\n# pc 00000000000100c4 va/inst 00000000000100c4 sr 8000000200006020\r\n# User fetch segfault @ 0x00000000000100c4\r\n# UVM_ERROR /home/lanius/code/cva6/cva6/corev_apu/tb/ariane_tb.sv(112) @ 91491750: reporter [Core Test] *** FAILED *** (tohost = 2147483647)\r\n```\r\nThe exact command I used is\r\n```\r\nmake sim elf-bin=$RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk target-options=hello.elf batch-mode=1\r\n```\r\nI use the changes proposed in #988 to get the simulation to run. I got to the linked commit by bisecting the simulation, one before and it works, that one and it breaks. I have attached the trace logs for the two cases to this issue as well.\r\n[trace_hart_0_commit.log](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/10216675/trace_hart_0_commit.log)\r\n[trace_hart_0_commit_broken_shortened.log](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/10216698/trace_hart_0_commit_broken_shortened.log)\r\n I had to shorten the broken commit log to fulfill the github requirements. The first difference occurs around line 146088, where in the correct simulation,\r\n```\r\nld             a0, 0(s8)             a0  :0000000000000000 s8  :ffffffc000098000 VA: ffffffc000098000 PA: 00000080098000\r\n```\r\nand in broken simulation\r\n```\r\nld             a0, 0(s8)             a0  :000000008009b000 s8  :ffffffc000098000 VA: ffffffc000098000 PA: 00000080098000\r\n```\r\nNote that this happens after 44025850ns, so well before the actual issue results in an error. I am not sure if this is linked to the issue I am seeing.\r\n\r\nIt seems in general, the questasim and VCS flows are not well tested (there are some other issues, like the target-options not propagating to VCS). Is it possible to extend the CI flow to run the same tests on the two simulators as well? This would have caught the issue raised in #1008. Running a barebones pk example as part of the pipeline should find the problem discussed in this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1014/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1021","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1021/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1021/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1021/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1021","id":1500445025,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085Zbvlh","number":1021,"title":"[BUG]

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\nOn page A3-45 (AXI3 write transaction dependencies), the [AXI spec](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0022/hc) says: \"The Manager must not wait for the Subordinate to assert AWREADY or WREADY before asserting AWVALID or WVALID.\"\r\n\r\nIn core/cache_subsystem/std_cache_subsystem.sv, this seems to be violated: A new W channel element is pushed to i_fifo_w_channel only when aw_valid and aw_ready. As long as aw_ready is not asserted, no element is pushed to the FIFO. w_select_arbiter remains zero and i_stream_mux_w drives axi_req_o.w_valid low.\r\n\r\nWhen an AXI subordinate waits for both aw_valid and w_valid before asserting aw_ready and w_ready, as it is allowed to, the AXI bus deadlocks. To reproduce: Wire up [axi_to_mem](https://github.com/pulp-platform/axi) directly to the cva6 module configured with std_cache_subsystem. Deadlock occurs on first store. Inserting an axi_cut instance between cva6 and axi_to_mem resolves the deadlock.\r\n\r\nThe condition `.push_i ( axi_req_o.aw_valid & axi_resp_i.aw_ready )` seems logically important for how std_cache_subsystem works. As I have little knowlege about the module, I am not sure how the problem could be resolved or whether this is a user problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1029/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1031","id":1531450123,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085bSBML","number":1031,"title":"[BUG] Issue in Verilator compile: blocked and non-blocking assignment to inp_pipe_valid in fpnew_fma.sv","user":{"login":"rsnikhil","id":3867081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjcwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3867081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil","html_url":"https://github.com/rsnikhil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsnikhil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2205679159,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA1Njc5MTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Type:Bug","name":"Type:Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":"For bugs in the RTL, Documentation, Verification environment or Tool and Build system"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2023-01-12T22:34:11Z","updated_at":"2023-01-26T17:20:09Z","closed_at":"2023-01-26T17:20:09Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\nI'm trying to compile cva6 (RV64, Sv39) under Verilator.\r\nI encounter the following error from Verilator:\r\n\r\n    %Error-BLKANDNBLK: /home/nikhil/Git/cva6/core/fpu/src/fpnew_fma.sv:106:59:\r\n    Unsupported: Blocked and non-blocking assignments to same variable:\r\n    'mkTop_HW_Side.awsteria_hw.awsteria_system.awsteria_core.core_inner_reclocked.\r\n       cva6_core.i_cva6.ex_stage_i.fpu_gen.fpu_i.fpu_gen.i_fpnew_bulk.gen_operation_groups[0].\r\n         i_opgroup_block.gen_parallel_slices[0].active_format.i_fmt_slice.gen_num_lanes[0].\r\n           active_lane.lane_instance.i_fma.inp_pipe_valid_q'\r\n    106 |   logic                  [0:NUM_INP_REGS]                 inp_pipe_valid_q;\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a valid complaint, based on the following analysis.\r\nLooking at the cited file and line number (cva6/core/fpu/src/fpnew_fma.sv:106:59:)\r\n\r\nThere is the following blocking assignment to 'inp_pipe_valid_q[0]:\r\n\r\n      118 |   assign inp_pipe_valid_q[0]    = in_valid_i;\r\n\r\nThen, in the following lines:\r\n\r\n      122 |   for (genvar i = 0; i < NUM_INP_REGS; i++) begin : gen_input_pipeline\r\n      ...\r\n      128 |     // Valid: enabled by ready signal, synchronous clear with the flush signal\r\n      130 |     `FFLARNC(inp_pipe_valid_q[i+1], inp_pipe_valid_q[i], inp_pipe_ready[i],\r\n                         flush_i, 1'b0, clk_i, rst_ni)\r\n\r\nI found the `FFLARNC macro in two files:\r\n  1. common/submodules/common_cells/include/common_cells/registers.svh:199\r\n  2. core/fpu/src/common_cells/include/common_cells/registers.svh:202\r\n\r\nWhichever one is used, the above lines (122, 130) seem to perform a non-blocking assignment to 'inp_pipe_valid_q[0]' (i.e.,\r\ninp_pipe_valid_q[i] when i == 0 in the genvar loop.\r\n\r\nSo,\r\n* Is this analysis correct?\r\n* If so, what is the solution?

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nI just cloned the repo today (02/08/2023), and I have verilator version 4.110 2021-02-25 rev v4.110.\r\nAfter running `make verilate DEBUG=1`, running `work-ver/Variane_testharness -v hello.vcd $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk hello.elf` does not work. \r\nThe -v option does not work as this is the output: `work-ver/Variane_testharness: invalid option -- 'v'`.\r\nIf I try appending the options at the end instead: \r\n`work-ver/Variane_testharness $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk hello.elf -v hello.vcd`\r\nIt runs but does not produce any .vcd files. So, I guess the options are just ignored.\r\n\r\nI realized that this issue has been mentioned before in issue  #1021 .\r\nSo, I tried `make verilate TRACE_FAST=1 DEBUG=1`, and I already have set  $VERILATOR_ROOT variable.\r\nAnd like @AnikBalo, the make fails with these errors at the end:\r\n`\r\nriane_testharness__Trace__6__Slow.o Variane_testharness__Trace__6__Slow.cpp\r\nccache g++  -I.  -MMD -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/vltstd -DVM_COVERAGE=0 -DVM_SC=0 -DVM_TRACE=1 -DVM_TRACE_FST=0 -faligned-new -fcf-protection=none -Wno-bool-operation -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-uninitialized -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-shadow     -I/include -I/include -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/cva6/riscv-toolchain/include -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/cva6/riscv-toolchain/include  -std=c++11 -I../corev_apu/tb/dpi -O3  -DVL_DEBUG  -DVL_THREADED -std=gnu++14  -c -o Variane_testharness__Trace__7__Slow.o Variane_testharness__Trace__7__Slow.cpp\r\nccache g++  -I.  -MMD -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/vltstd -DVM_COVERAGE=0 -DVM_SC=0 -DVM_TRACE=1 -DVM_TRACE_FST=0 -faligned-new -fcf-protection=none -Wno-bool-operation -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-uninitialized -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-shadow     -I/include -I/include -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/cva6/riscv-toolchain/include -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/cva6/riscv-toolchain/include  -std=c++11 -I../corev_apu/tb/dpi -O3  -DVL_DEBUG  -DVL_THREADED -std=gnu++14  -c -o Variane_testharness__Trace__8__Slow.o Variane_testharness__Trace__8__Slow.cpp\r\nccache g++  -I.  -MMD -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/vltstd -DVM_COVERAGE=0 -DVM_SC=0 -DVM_TRACE=1 -DVM_TRACE_FST=0 -faligned-new -fcf-protection=none -Wno-bool-operation -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-uninitialized -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-shadow     -I/include -I/include -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/cva6/riscv-toolchain/include -I/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/cva6/riscv-toolchain/include  -std=c++11 -I../corev_apu/tb/dpi -O3  -DVL_DEBUG  -DVL_THREADED -std=gnu++14  -c -o Variane_testharness__Trace__9__Slow.o Variane_testharness__Trace__9__Slow.cpp\r\ng++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake[1]: *** [/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/verilated.mk:238: Variane_testharness__12__Slow.o] Error 1\r\nmake[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....\r\ng++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake[1]: *** [/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/verilated.mk:238: Variane_testharness__Trace__2__Slow.o] Error 1\r\ng++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake[1]: *** [/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/verilated.mk:238: Variane_testharness__11__Slow.o] Error 1\r\ng++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake[1]: *** [/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/verilated.mk:238: Variane_testharness__Trace__Slow.o] Error 1\r\ng++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake[1]: *** [/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/verilated.mk:238: Variane_testharness__20__Slow.o] Error 1\r\ng++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake[1]: *** [/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/verilated.mk:238: Variane_testharness__22__Slow.o] Error 1\r\ng++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake[1]: *** [/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/verilator/include/verilated.mk:238: Variane_testharness__6__Slow.o] Error 1\r\nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/home/ewoo5/ece498sjp/cva6/work-ver'\r\nmake: *** [Makefile:639: verilate] Error 2\r\n`\r\n\r\nAny idea what is wrong?

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\nI want to generate a VCD file to view the waveform using GTKwave to see each signal. To do this, I had executed `make verilate DEBUG=1` in advance, and I tried using the following commands under the 'cva6' folder to get a VCD file:\r\n`work-ver/Variane_testharness $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk hello.elf`\r\n`work-ver/Variane_testharness --v $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk hello.elf`\r\nHowever, both commands only displayed 'Hello CVA6!' and didn't generate a VCD file. \r\n\r\nI also tried the following commands from #282:\r\n`work-ver/Variane_testharness -v dump.vcd $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk hello.elf`\r\n`work-ver/Variane_testharness -v $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk hello.elf`\r\nThe former resulted in an 'invalid option' error, while the latter didn't work. When I ran this command:\r\n`work-ver/Variane_testharness --v dump.vcd $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk hello.elf`\r\nIt displayed the message：\r\nThis emulator compiled with JTAG Remote Bitbang client.

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\r\n\r\n### Bug Description\r\n\r\nHi there!\r\n\r\nI've detected a bug in CVA6, potentially in CVFPU but I'm not certain so I post it here. Please let me know if this is a CVFPU bug, and I can move it there.\r\n\r\n## Brief bug description\r\n\r\nA conversion of nan from simple to double may set a lot of bits in the mantissa, unexpectedly, under specific microarchitectural conditions.\r\n\r\n## Example instance 1\r\n\r\nIn this instance, we convert the single-precision `0xffffffffff800000` using `fcvt.d.s`.\r\nWe expect to get `0xfff0000000000000` as a result, but under the circumstances induced in the very simple ELF, we get `0xffefffffffffffff`. I confirmed the expected result with spike, and in the snippet further below in CVA6.\r\n\r\n[Here is the ELF and waveforms of the bug.](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/10891811/nancvt.zip)\r\nA symptom of the bug is the first write to address `0x18`, which essentially writes the result of the conversion.\r\n\r\nHere you can observe that the value dumped is erroneous.\r\n\r\n![waveform](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28906668/222960331-1a743cca-73b2-4583-bf87-05c41c0bfa10.png)\r\n\r\n## Example instance 2\r\n\r\nIn this instance, we convert the single-precision `0xffffffff7f800000` using `fcvt.d.s`.\r\nWe expect to get `0x7ff0000000000000` as a result, but under the circumstances induced in the very simple ELF, we get `0x7fefffffffffffff`. I confirmed the expected result with spike, and in the snippet further below in CVA6.\r\n\r\n[Here is the ELF and waveforms of the bug.](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/files/10891843/nancvt2.zip)\r\nA symptom of the bug is the sixth write to address `0x18`, which essentially writes the result of the conversion.\r\n\r\n![waveform](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28906668/222961034-a5056037-d19e-4adb-b8b7-4991e202916f.png)\r\n\r\n## Example instance that runs correctly\r\n\r\nInterestingly, performing the conversion out of context works, for example this snippet executes apparently correctly. It is similar if we replace the values with the values of the second instance.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  .section \".text.init\",\"ax\",@progbits\r\n  .globl _start\r\n  .align 2\r\n_start:\r\n\r\n  # Enable the FPU\r\n  li t0, 0x2000\r\n  csrs mstatus, t0\r\n  csrw\tfcsr,x0\r\n\r\n  la t0, .fdata0\r\n  fld fa5, (t0)\r\n\r\n  fcvt.d.s ft0, fa5\r\n\r\n  li t0, 0x18\r\n  fsd ft0, (t0)\r\n\r\n  sw x0, 0(x0)\r\n\r\ninfinite_loop:\r\n  j infinite_loop\r\n\r\n.section \".fdata0\",\"ax\",@progbits\r\n  .8byte 0xffffffffff800000\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore I deduce that this is conditioned by some microarchitectural effects (maybe branch prediction but I am not certain).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nFlavien","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1091/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1095","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1095/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1095/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1095/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1095","id":1611559621,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085gDnLF","number":1095,"title":"PMP

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\n## Bug Explanation\r\n\r\nI noticed the docs say that Out-of-Order can occur between the multiplier and the ALU, however this is not the case according to the RTL.\r\n\r\nDocs:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/a29b231070f2dccca53eae2681120116633a4ffc/docs/03_cva6_design/issue_stage.md?plain=1#L42-L54\r\n\r\nRTL:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/adf99b53042d2b14cbbb36689babf8cd4c03cf81/core/issue_read_operands.sv#L135-L152\r\n\r\nFor example, I have this code snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        div     t2, t0, t1\r\n        fsqrt.s f1, f1\r\n        lw      t5, 0(s1)\r\n        add     t6, t0, t1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is it's execute

`div` finishes.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Fix\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n\r\n* The RTL could be changed to separate the ALU and multiplier into two separate busy signals.\r\n* The example in the docs could be changed to something else, such as `div` and `lsu`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1109","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1109/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1109/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1109/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1109","id":1616647474,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085gXBUy","number":1109,"title":"[BUG]

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\n@Nils Wistoff @Florian Zaruba,   In the ARA PR, AXI parameters are defined as seen below. I think this code cannot work. As example, when AxiAddrWidth is defined by ariane module (which instantiates cva6) and axi_ar_chan_t is not defined by ariane module, axi_ar_chan_t will be defined from ariane_axi::AddrWidth, which is not the wanted value. Because in that case, axi_ar_chan_t should be defined from AxiAddrWidth.  Tell me if I am wrong !\r\nMoreover, almost all the parameters are defined in config package, why defining them in the module parameter ?   Code would be simpler by defining parameters always with the same strategy. If you need a special configuration for ARA, what I can understand of course, you can add an ARA configuration to the cva6 repository.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56552370/223958207-c9cedefb-34c1-4774-a82a-3ca2577185b4.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1116","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1116/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1116/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1116/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1116","id":1624837681,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085g2Q4x","number":1116,"title":"minstreth

Linting is used to verify adherence to specified design coding rules that prevent synthesis issues, functional bugs and enforce coding styles for readability & re-use. For that purpose, we have to enable lint warnings and remove/waive them where necessary. To achieve this objective, a set of PRs will be created removing a batch of lint warnings. This issue tracks the status updates and the relative PRs related to Lint warnings related to all the github lint cases.     \r\n\r\n### Guidelines for Lint Issues\r\n\r\n- For Verilator Lint Warning Labels, please refer to [this link](https://veripool.org/guide/latest/warnings.html#list-of-warnings)\r\n- All the CVA6 Lint Related issues will start with LINT keyword and provide the specific info related to the warning\r\n- Priorities are being assigned to every Lint Issue with P1 being the highest\r\n  - Resolution of P1 Lint Issues -> 7 days\r\n  - Resolution of P2 and P3 Lint Issues -> 15 days\r\n- Deferred (represented by D) Issues are those which are outside core/ directory and don't have much priority right now\r\n\r\n### Co-Author/Assignee \r\nThese issues are co-authored/resolved by [Muhammad Mustafa-10xE](https://github.com/mustafa7755)\r\n\r\n## Status \r\n\r\nThis table specifies all the warnings related to lint in CVA6 RTL and classifies those into specific categories.

As mentioned above, both are currently in used, the first to define ariane port, and the second by the rvfi_tracer.

@zarubaf ,\r\n\r\nI see in the CVA6 paper and the code in `ariane_regfile.sv` that the register file has 32x 64-bit registers (one of them tied to 0) for the integer part.\r\nI also see that WAW hazards are resolved by a light-weight renaming scheme, through the increase of the logical register address space by 1 bit (essentially doubling the amount of registers).\r\n\r\nI was wondering, how

```\r\n  icache_areq_o.fetch_exception = {riscv::INSTR_ACCESS_FAULT, {{riscv::XLEN-riscv::VLEN{1'b0}}, icache_areq_i.fetch_vaddr}, 1'b1};\r\n  ```\r\n  - or it should be using `icache_areq_o.fetch_paddr` instead of `icache_areq_i.fetch_vaddr` i.e., like this:\r\n  ```\r\n  icache_areq_o.fetch_exception = {riscv::INSTR_ACCESS_FAULT, {{riscv::XLEN-riscv::VLEN{1'b0}}, icache_areq_o.fetch_paddr}, 1'b1};\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- RISC-V spec says:\r\n```\r\nIf mtval is written with a nonzero value when a misaligned load or store causes an access-fault or\r\npage-fault exception, then mtval will contain the virtual address of the portion of the access that\r\ncaused the fault.\r\n```\r\n- I might be wrong but in my opinion changing PLEN to VLEN would be the correct solution\r\n\n\n### Description of Done\n\nWhen concerned RTL line would get fixed.\n\n### Associated PRs\n\n_No

Hello @JeanRochCoulon, @zarubaf\r\n\r\nI know that this Pull Request is now merged and closed, but I think we have an issue here: we are keeping a redundancy in the definitions for the AXI interface.\r\n\r\nIn the modifications that @niwis introduced some months ago, AXI definitions are passed as parameters to the CVA6 module. In my humble opinion, this is good and should be the unique definition of AXI parameters. By the way, for completeness, I think that types for the B and R channels shall also be passed as parameters.\r\n\r\nIf we define AXI parameters in the different packages (CVA6 configuration file + ariane_axi_pkg + ariane_pkg) we have a potential misalignment in values between those passed as parameters and those in packages.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  I do not think that AXI definitions shall be part of CVA6 configuration packages. The core is one thing, the NoC interface is another. Currently, CVA6 cache subsystem supports two different interfaces: OpenPiton and AXI. And in the future, there could be others such as CHI, ACE, etc... In my opinion NoC interface depends on the system integration/configuration. The CVA6 configuration shall be used to define ISA extensions and microarchitectural parameters (e.g. scoreboard entries). Not SoC level parameters such as the NoC interface. If NoC parameters are defined in the CVA6 configuration file, we will see the number of configuration files grow in polynomial manner. \r\n\r\nMy two cents,\r\n\r\nCésar\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\r\n\r\n### Bug Description\r\n\r\nHi there!\r\n\r\nThe riscv privileged specification says:\r\n\r\n> Note that although CSRs and instructions are associated with one privilege level, they are also accessible at all higher privilege levels.\r\n\r\n[The CVA6 CSR specification](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/master/docs/01_cva6_user/ip-xact/cva6_csr.md) says about `scounteren`:\r\n> When HPMn is clear, attempts to read the hpmcountern register while executing in U-mode will cause an illegal instruction exception. When this bit is set, access to the corresponding register is permitted.\r\n\r\nHence, I understand that setting the correct bits of `scountern` should provide read access to `hpmcountern` in user mode, and hence in particular in machine mode.\r\n\r\n### Example snippet\r\n\r\nThis snippet should store 1 to address 0x10 but stores 0 instead.\r\nI checked the behavior with Spike, which does not throw an exception on reading hpmcounter3.\r\nIn contrast, CVA6 throws an illegal instruction exception.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  .section \".text.init\",\"ax\",@progbits\r\n  .globl _start\r\n  .align

Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\nI am unsure if this is a bug, or if this is somehow related to preloading etc.\r\nLooking at the CI runs (and validating by running verilator myself), some benchmarks perform significantly better than what I observe running them in questasim (First row is mcycle, second is minstret).:\r\n\r\n| Benchmark  | Verilator | Questasim |\r\n| ------------- | --------- | --------- |\r\n| Dhrystone (mcycle )    | 246878   | **750468** |\r\n| Dhrystone (minstret)   | 196529   | 196029 |\r\n| Median (mcycle )        | 7692      | 7813 |\r\n| Median (minstret)       | 4159       | 4156 |\r\n| Multiply (mcycle )       | 33482  | 33991|\r\n| Multiply (minstret)      | 24104 | 24101|\r\n| QSort (mcycle )       | 230134 | 270068 |\r\n| QSort (minstret)      | 123803 | 127368 |\r\n| RSort (mcycle )       | 224664 | **813692** |\r\n| RSort (minstret)      | 171157 | 171154|\r\n| towers (mcycle )       | 6815 | **46534** |\r\n| towers (minstret)      | 6170 | 4855 |\r\n| vvadd (mcycle )       | 2462 | 4700 |\r\n| vvadd  (minstret)      | 2420 | 2417 |\r\n\r\nI have used the command ` make run-benchmarks batch-mode=1 max_cycles=10000000`. Is this is the expected behavior, i.e. that the benchmarks do not produce the same results? I have tried to make them align, but I did not find a way to do so. This currently \"looks like\" the IPC are sometimes orders of magnitude worse when simulated in questasim.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run `make sim elf-bin=tmp/riscv-tests/build/benchmarks/towers.riscv batch-mode=1` and note the reported mcycle and minstret values\r\n2. Run `work-ver/Variane_testharness tmp/riscv-tests/build/benchmarks/towers.riscv` and note the reported mcycle and minstret values\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: The values should be roughly identical. \r\nObserved behavior: The value for the number of cycles differs drastically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1222","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1222/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1222/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1222/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/issues/1222","id":1695603808,"node_id":"I_kwDOBxJ9085lENxg","number":1222,"title":"execute work-ver/Variane_testharness $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk hello.elf","user":{"login":"Shuangxie0708","id":132559519,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-aynw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132559519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708","html_url":"https://github.com/Shuangxie0708","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shuangxie0708/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2205679159,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA1Njc5MTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openhwgroup/cva6/labels/Type:Bug","name":"Type:Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":"For bugs in the RTL, Documentation, Verification environment or Tool and Build system"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-05-04T09:15:52Z","updated_at":"2023-05-04T09:15:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Is there an existing CVA6 bug for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing bug issues\n\n### Bug Description\n\nWhen I running User-Space Applications..I execute work-ver/Variane_testharness $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/pk hello.elf There is below error that failed.\r\nBut I run work-ver/Variane_testharness rv64um-v-divuw, it is successful.\r\nCould you help me solve this problem that why I failed when running user-space applications.
