The pros and cons of combining two of the instructions into one somewhat more CISC'y instruction - to reduce code size (as well as eliminate use of a result Xreg and needing to specify it in the instruction encoding) - was discussed. The recommendation is to take this latter approach, resulting in just two SS-LP-CFI instructions (the CISCy-ness is considered very limited, especially when performed using cacheable idempotent memory, and felt to be justified in this case).\r\n- The TG suggested that the `sspop` as defined is retained to support mode of operation where shadow stack is the only return address stack. This would be usable by `-march=native` binaries and also JIT code. Binaries built in this fashion will not be portable. There are issues with providing compressed instructions for both this purpose and for the shadow stack checking addition, and so the ARC proposes that only the shadow checking instructions would be have compressed format Zimops definitions, and the new ABI would need to use new non-Zimops instructions.\r\n- The `sspush`,  `sspop`, `ssamoswap`, and `sspopchk` instructions should be specified as requiring use of idempotent cacheable memory (and otherwise a fault can be taken as a PMA violation).\r\n- For the `sspush` and `sspopchk` SS-LP-CFI instructions, 16-bit compressed encodings (as well as 32-bit encodings) will be provided. Presently Zimop does not define compressed encodings - AR is working on allocating compressed Zimop encoding space.\r\n\r\nIn issue #48 we discussed whether we need to support `sspush` with all sources or they can be constrained to `x1` and `x5`. Especially with this update to combine the `sspop` and `sschkra`, we would want to take the opportunity to do that and free up some of the other encodings.\r\n\r\nThe updates are as summarized:\r\n1. Update `sspush` and `sspop` to support only `x1` and `x5` as source and destination respectively\r\n2. Drop the `sschkra` instruction\r\n3. Define a `sspopchk` instruction\r\n4. Add compressed encoding's SS-LP-CFI `sspush` and `sspopchk` instructions\r\n\r\nThe `sspopchk` has a register source rs1 and no destination (rd is x0). \r\nOnly `x1` and `x5` are supported encodings for `rs1`.\r\nIts operation is as follows:\r\n```\r\nIf (xBCFIE = 1)\r\n    temp = *[ssp] # Load temp from address in ssp\r\n    if temp != [rs1] \r\n        Raise illegal-instruction exception\r\n    endif\r\n    [ssp] = [ssp] + (XLEN/8) # increment ssp by XLEN/8    \r\nendif\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/68","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/68/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/68/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/68/events","html_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/68","id":1647657354,"node_id":"I_kwDOHfymkc5iNUGK","number":68,"title":"stack diagram would be useful","user":{"login":"sjwallach","id":32551848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTUxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32551848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach","html_url":"https://github.com/sjwallach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwallach/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-03-30T13:44:19Z","updated_at":"2023-04-04T14:49:27Z","closed_at":"2023-04-04T14:49:26Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"i realize that creating a diagram takes lots of effort.  however it would be useful  to show:\r\n\r\nhow the shadow stack is referenced (the specific registers)\r\n.the various push/pop  protocols\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/68/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/69","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/69/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/69/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/69/events","html_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/69","id":1648047114,"node_id":"I_kwDOHfymkc5iOzQK","number":69,"title":"Editorial;

Implicit assumption that setjmp is a leaf function and doesn't spill to the shadow stack\r\n\r\nThe spec mentions that the compiler/author can choose not to use the shadow stack for leaf functions, but does not mandate it [1]. However, this optimization is assumed by the setjmp/longjmp example; if setjmp did spill to the shadow stack, there would be an off-by-one error in longjmp: it would be partially restoring the state of setjmp, not setjmp's caller.\r\n\r\nCould this assumption be made explicit in the text?\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n> A leaf function i.e. a function that does not itself make function calls does not need to push the link register to the shadow stack or pop it from the shadow stack in either shadow stack mode or in control stack mode. The return value *may* be held in the link register itself for the duration of the leaf function execution.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added)\r\n\r\nThere is somewhat stronger wording in the Introduction:\r\n\r\n> The shadow stack is used to spill the link register if required by non-leaf functions.\r\n\r\nbut I read that as a suggestion of where the shadow stack could be used, not as an exclusion of other uses.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### 2. Editorial: confusing code comment for setjmp\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // read and save top of stack pointer to jmp_buf\r\n  asm(\"ssprr %0\" : \"=r\"(cur_ssp):);\r\n  jmp_buf->saved_ssp = cur_ssp;\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould this comment be \"read and save shadow stack pointer to jmp_buf\"? I interpreted the comment to be referring to the code that immediately follows.\r\n\r\n(The existing comment could be argued to be technically correct, because setjmp does typically save the (non-shadow) stack pointer, or thereabouts.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### 3. Editorial: guard pages are mentioned in the context of longjmp/setjmp, which is partly out of context\r\n\r\nThe text currently reads:\r\n\r\n> The unwind function must verify that it does not accidentally unwind past the bounds of the shadow stack. Shadow stacks are expected to be bounded on each end using guard pages i.e. pages that do not have a shadow stack attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnwinding justifies why a guard page is needed at the bottom of the shadow stack, but it does not explain why a guard page is needed at the top end of the shadow stack. I can imagine there are good reasons (not overflowing the shadow stack into user memory etc.), but it's not explained here (and the longjmp/setjmp section would not the proper place to do so). Perhaps the guard page requirement could be stated in section 3.5.1 (where the requirement to not alias writeable non-shadow-stack pages is listed)?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80/events","html_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80","id":1654724523,"node_id":"I_kwDOHfymkc5ioRer","number":80,"title":"Nitpick: comments in sspop and sspopchk examples (Section 3.2)","user":{"login":"thurstond","id":6995329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTUzMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6995329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond","html_url":"https://github.com/thurstond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2023-04-04T23:59:44Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T22:29:36Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T12:27:07Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"```\r\n  sspopchk x1 # compare link register x1 to shadow\r\n             # return address; faults if not same\r\n  #\r\n  # sspop loads the value from location addressed by ssp and\r\n  # compares the loaded value to the value held in the register\r\n```\r\nThe code is sspopchk but the comment mentions 'sspop'.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nConversely:\r\n```\r\n  sspop x1 # pop return address from shadow stack\r\n  #\r\n  # sspop loads the value from location addressed by ssp into\r\n  # destination # register and updates ssp to (ssp + XLEN/8)\r\n  # - does a pop.

This instruction is used\r\nwhen labels wider than 17-bit are used.\r\n\r\nAFAICS it would be equally valid to use the lower+upper labels to handle the 17-bit case; i.e., it is legal to check the lower+upper labels without checking the middle label:\r\n```\r\nfoo:\r\n  lpsll $10\r\n  lpsul $30 # Instead of lpsml\r\n  jalr %ra, %x10\r\n\r\nbar:\r\n  lpcll $10\r\n  lpcul $30 # Instead of lpcml\r\n  : \r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this allowed?\r\n\r\nIf so, the text is not quite accurate in stating that lpsml is used for >9-bit labels and lpsul is used for >17-bit labels.\r\n\r\nBesides being a technicality, being able to check the upper label without checking the middle label gives additional multi-labelling (without call site specific entrypoint) flexibility e.g.,\r\n```\r\nCall site A:\r\n- set lower label to 10\r\n- set middle label to 20\r\n- [high label is implicitly set to 0]\r\n\r\nCall site B:\r\n- set lower label to 10\r\n- [middle label is implicitly set to 0]\r\n- [high label is implicitly set to 0]\r\n\r\nCall site C:\r\n- set lower label to 10\r\n- [middle label is implicitly set to 0]\r\n- set high label to 30\r\n\r\nCall site D:\r\n- set lower label to 10\r\n- set middle label to 20\r\n- set high label to 30\r\n\r\n\r\nX prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n- check middle label is 20\r\n\r\nY prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n\r\nZ prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n- check middle label is 0\r\n\r\nU prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n- check high label is 30\r\n\r\nV prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n- check high label is 0\r\n```\r\nenables the CFI policy:\r\n```\r\nA -> {X, Y,       V}\r\nB -> {   Y, Z,    V}\r\nC -> {   Y, Z, U  }\r\nD -> {X, Y,    U  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany more policies are possible by varying the combinations of label values.\r\n\r\n### Wacky idea: split the label into more pieces\r\n\r\nCurrently, the 25-bits of the landing pad label are split into 9/8/8 low/mid/high bits. However, if it was split into more pieces (e.g., 7/6/6/6 bits, with four set/check landing pad instructions; or 5/5/5/5/5 with five instruction pairs, etc.), it will give even more flexibility to do multi-labelling without trampolines.

The `sspop` was motivated to reduce the code size of the program. Subsequently, a combination instruction `sspopchk` that  combined the functionality of the `sspop` and `sschkra` was introduced that leads to further code size reduction. The use of `sspopchk` is thus the preferred method for programs operating in shadow stack mode. With this change the `sspop` was retained to support the control stack mode. In control stack mode the program does not push a return address on the regular stack - the return address variable is held only on the shadow stack. \r\n\r\nWhile originally motivated, the `sspop` introduces certain complexities for implementations due to its dual-dest nature as discussed at length in the email thread referenced above.\r\n\r\nThe use of `sspop` compared to a instruction pair `ssload`+`sspinc` does not lead to a significant code size increase as illustrated below. The function in control stack mode uses 6 additional code bytes. The function in shadow stack mode uses 4 additional code bytes. The extra load and store to the regular stack is elided in control stack mode.\r\n```\r\ncontrol_stack_mode:    shadow_stack_mode:\r\n addi sp, sp, -24            addi sp, sp, -32\r\n-c.sdsp x1, 24(sp)           c.sdsp x1, 24(sp)\r\n+c.sspush x1                +c.sspush x1\r\n:                                    : \r\n-c.ldsp x5, 24(sp)           c.ldsp x5, 24(sp)\r\n+ssload x1                  +c.sspopchk x5 \r\n+sspinc $1\r\n addi sp, sp, 24             addi sp, sp, 32\r\n ret                         ret\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe `sspinc` can now also be used by unwinders to do fast unwinding. The `ssp` CSR however will need to stay URW to support pthreads and coroutine type user mode thread switching.\r\n\r\nTo support the micro-architecture simplification, the following is proposed:\r\n1. Drop `sspop` and redefine the code points presently defined for it as `ssload`\r\n2. Introduce a `sspinc` instruction that increments `ssp` by a non-zero unsigned 5-bit immediate scaled by

The `a0` register is expected to hold the memory address stored the checkpoint, the value should be `ssp`. Therefore, the value of `*[a0]` is expected to be `ssp+(XLEN/8)`, and the `t0` register is holding the value after `ssamoswap` instruction. In order to check the equivalent of the `t0` and `a0` register, you need to add `(XLEN+8)` to the `a0` register instead of the `t0` register. The correct equation would be: `t0 == a0+(XLEN/8)`. The `t0` register is still holding the top return address pointer, `ssp+(XLEN/8)`, after equivalent check.\r\n\r\nThe updated example is shown as following:\r\n```\r\n# The a0 register holds the pointer to top of new shadow\r\n# to switch to. The current ssp is first pushed on the current\r\n# shadow stack and the ssp is restored from new shadow stack\r\nsave_shadow_stack_pointer:\r\n    ssprr  x5                   # read ssp and push value onto\r\n    sspush x5                   # shadow stack. The [ssp] now\r\n    addi   x5, x5, -(XLEN/8)    # holds ssp+(XLEN/8). The [x5]\r\n                                # now holds ssp. Save away x5\r\n                                # into a context structure to\r\n                                # restore later.\r\nrestore_shadow_stack_pointer:\r\n    ssamoswap t0, a0, x0        #

committee reviewed the SS-LP-CFI instructions and various points of discussion led to the conclusion that the new SS-LP-CFI instructions will be common and code size will be a material concern and ARC has suggested the following updates:\r\n- Combine `sspop` and `sschkra` into a single instruction - `sspopchk`. The pros and cons of combining two of the instructions into one somewhat more CISC'y instruction - to reduce code size (as well as eliminate use of a result Xreg and needing to specify it in the instruction encoding) - was discussed. The recommendation is to take this latter approach, resulting in just two SS-LP-CFI instructions (the CISCy-ness is considered very limited, especially when performed using cacheable idempotent memory, and felt to be justified in this case).\r\n- The TG suggested that the `sspop` as defined is retained to support mode of operation where shadow stack is the only return address stack. This would be usable by `-march=native` binaries and also JIT code. Binaries built in this fashion will not be portable. There are issues with providing compressed instructions for both this purpose and for the shadow stack checking addition, and so the ARC proposes that only the shadow checking instructions would be have compressed format Zimops definitions, and the new ABI would need to use new non-Zimops instructions.\r\n- The `sspush`,  `sspop`, `ssamoswap`, and `sspopchk` instructions should be specified as requiring use of idempotent cacheable memory (and otherwise a fault can be taken as a PMA violation).\r\n- For the `sspush` and `sspopchk` SS-LP-CFI instructions, 16-bit compressed encodings (as well as 32-bit encodings) will be provided. Presently Zimop does not define compressed encodings - AR is working on allocating compressed Zimop encoding space.\r\n\r\nIn issue #48 we discussed whether we need to support `sspush` with all sources or they can be constrained to `x1` and `x5`. Especially with this update to combine the `sspop` and `sschkra`, we would want to take the opportunity to do that and free up some of the other encodings.\r\n\r\nThe updates are as summarized:\r\n1. Update `sspush` and `sspop` to support only `x1` and `x5` as source and destination respectively\r\n2. Drop the `sschkra` instruction\r\n3. Define a `sspopchk` instruction\r\n4. Add compressed encoding's SS-LP-CFI `sspush` and `sspopchk` instructions\r\n\r\nThe `sspopchk` has a register source rs1 and no destination (rd is x0). \r\nOnly `x1` and `x5` are supported encodings for `rs1`.\r\nIts operation is as follows:\r\n```\r\nIf (xBCFIE = 1)\r\n    temp = *[ssp] # Load temp from address in ssp\r\n    if temp != [rs1] \r\n        Raise illegal-instruction exception\r\n    endif\r\n    [ssp] = [ssp] + (XLEN/8) # increment ssp by XLEN/8

1. Implicit assumption that setjmp is a leaf function and doesn't spill to the shadow stack\r\n\r\nThe spec mentions that the compiler/author can choose not to use the shadow stack for leaf functions, but does not mandate it [1]. However, this optimization is assumed by the setjmp/longjmp example; if setjmp did spill to the shadow stack, there would be an off-by-one error in longjmp: it would be partially restoring the state of setjmp, not setjmp's caller.\r\n\r\nCould this assumption be made explicit in the text?\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n> A leaf function i.e. a function that does not itself make function calls does not need to push the link register to the shadow stack or pop it from the shadow stack in either shadow stack mode or in control stack mode. The return value *may* be held in the link register itself for the duration of the leaf function execution.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added)\r\n\r\nThere is somewhat stronger wording in the Introduction:\r\n\r\n> The shadow stack is used to spill the link register if required by non-leaf functions.\r\n\r\nbut I read that as a suggestion of where the shadow stack could be used, not as an exclusion of other uses.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### 2. Editorial: confusing code comment for setjmp\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // read and save top of stack pointer to jmp_buf\r\n  asm(\"ssprr %0\" : \"=r\"(cur_ssp):);\r\n  jmp_buf->saved_ssp = cur_ssp;\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould this comment be \"read and save shadow stack pointer to jmp_buf\"? I interpreted the comment to be referring to the code that immediately follows.\r\n\r\n(The existing comment could be argued to be technically correct, because setjmp does typically save the (non-shadow) stack pointer, or thereabouts.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### 3. Editorial: guard pages are mentioned in the context of longjmp/setjmp, which is partly out of context\r\n\r\nThe text currently reads:\r\n\r\n> The unwind function must verify that it does not accidentally unwind past the bounds of the shadow stack. Shadow stacks are expected to be bounded on each end using guard pages i.e. pages that do not have a shadow stack attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnwinding justifies why a guard page is needed at the bottom of the shadow stack, but it does not explain why a guard page is needed at the top end of the shadow stack. I can imagine there are good reasons (not overflowing the shadow stack into user memory etc.), but it's not explained here (and the longjmp/setjmp section would not the proper place to do so). Perhaps the guard page requirement could be stated in section 3.5.1 (where the requirement to not alias writeable non-shadow-stack pages is listed)?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80/events","html_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/80","id":1654724523,"node_id":"I_kwDOHfymkc5ioRer","number":80,"title":"Nitpick: comments in sspop and sspopchk examples (Section 3.2)","user":{"login":"thurstond","id":6995329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTUzMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6995329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond","html_url":"https://github.com/thurstond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurstond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2023-04-04T23:59:44Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T22:29:36Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T12:27:07Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"```\r\n  sspopchk x1 # compare link register x1 to shadow\r\n             # return address; faults if not same\r\n  #\r\n  # sspop loads the value from location addressed by ssp and\r\n  # compares the loaded value to the value held in the register\r\n```\r\nThe code is sspopchk but the comment mentions 'sspop'.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nConversely:\r\n```\r\n  sspop x1 # pop return address from shadow stack\r\n  #\r\n  # sspop loads the value from location addressed by ssp into\r\n  # destination # register and updates ssp to (ssp + XLEN/8)\r\n  # - does a pop.

This instruction is used\r\nwhen labels wider than 17-bit are used.\r\n\r\nAFAICS it would be equally valid to use the lower+upper labels to handle the 17-bit case; i.e., it is legal to check the lower+upper labels without checking the middle label:\r\n```\r\nfoo:\r\n  lpsll $10\r\n  lpsul $30 # Instead of lpsml\r\n  jalr %ra, %x10\r\n\r\nbar:\r\n  lpcll $10\r\n  lpcul $30 # Instead of lpcml\r\n  : \r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this allowed?\r\n\r\nIf so, the text is not quite accurate in stating that lpsml is used for >9-bit labels and lpsul is used for >17-bit labels.\r\n\r\nBesides being a technicality, being able to check the upper label without checking the middle label gives additional multi-labelling (without call site specific entrypoint) flexibility e.g.,\r\n```\r\nCall site A:\r\n- set lower label to 10\r\n- set middle label to 20\r\n- [high label is implicitly set to 0]\r\n\r\nCall site B:\r\n- set lower label to 10\r\n- [middle label is implicitly set to 0]\r\n- [high label is implicitly set to 0]\r\n\r\nCall site C:\r\n- set lower label to 10\r\n- [middle label is implicitly set to 0]\r\n- set high label to 30\r\n\r\nCall site D:\r\n- set lower label to 10\r\n- set middle label to 20\r\n- set high label to 30\r\n\r\n\r\nX prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n- check middle label is 20\r\n\r\nY prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n\r\nZ prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n- check middle label is 0\r\n\r\nU prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n- check high label is 30\r\n\r\nV prologue:\r\n- check lower label is 10\r\n- check high label is 0\r\n```\r\nenables the CFI policy:\r\n```\r\nA -> {X, Y,       V}\r\nB -> {   Y, Z,    V}\r\nC -> {   Y, Z, U  }\r\nD -> {X, Y,    U  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany more policies are possible by varying the combinations of label values.\r\n\r\n### Wacky idea: split the label into more pieces\r\n\r\nCurrently, the 25-bits of the landing pad label are split into 9/8/8 low/mid/high bits. However, if it was split into more pieces (e.g., 7/6/6/6 bits, with four set/check landing pad instructions; or 5/5/5/5/5 with five instruction pairs, etc.), it will give even more flexibility to do multi-labelling without trampolines. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/82/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/82/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/83","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/83/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/83/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/83/events","html_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/pull/83","id":1656383036,"node_id":"PR_kwDOHfymkc5Nt2oq","number":83,"title":"Issue 80","user":{"login":"ved-rivos","id":91900059,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXpImw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91900059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos","html_url":"https://github.com/ved-rivos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-04-05T22:29:04Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T00:50:52Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T22:30:28Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/pulls/83","html_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/pull/83","diff_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/pull/83.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/pull/83.patch","merged_at":"2023-04-05T22:30:28Z"},"body":"1.

to continue discussion from this mail list [thread](https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-ss-lp-cfi/message/36).\r\n\r\nInitially, `sspop` was introduced as the only way to pop a return address from a shadow stack and was paired with  `sschkra` instruction to check  the shadow return address with that obtained from the data stack.  The `sspop` was motivated to reduce the code size of the program. Subsequently, a combination instruction `sspopchk` that  combined the functionality of the `sspop` and `sschkra` was introduced that leads to further code size reduction. The use of `sspopchk` is thus the preferred method for programs operating in shadow stack mode. With this change the `sspop` was retained to support the control stack mode. In control stack mode the program does not push a return address on the regular stack - the return address variable is held only on the shadow stack. \r\n\r\nWhile originally motivated, the `sspop` introduces certain complexities for implementations due to its dual-dest nature as discussed at length in the email thread referenced above.\r\n\r\nThe use of `sspop` compared to a instruction pair `ssload`+`sspinc` does not lead to a significant code size increase as illustrated below. The function in control stack mode uses 6 additional code bytes. The function in shadow stack mode uses 4 additional code bytes. The extra load and store to the regular stack is elided in control stack mode.\r\n```\r\ncontrol_stack_mode:    shadow_stack_mode:\r\n addi sp, sp, -24            addi sp, sp, -32\r\n-c.sdsp x1, 24(sp)           c.sdsp x1, 24(sp)\r\n+c.sspush x1                +c.sspush x1\r\n:                                    : \r\n-c.ldsp x5, 24(sp)           c.ldsp x5, 24(sp)\r\n+ssload x1                  +c.sspopchk x5 \r\n+sspinc $1\r\n addi sp, sp, 24             addi sp, sp, 32\r\n ret                         ret\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe `sspinc` can now also be used by unwinders to do fast unwinding. The `ssp` CSR however will need to stay URW to support pthreads and coroutine type user mode thread switching.\r\n\r\nTo support the micro-architecture simplification, the following is proposed:\r\n1. Drop `sspop` and redefine the code points presently defined for it as `ssload`\r\n2. Introduce a `sspinc` instruction that increments `ssp` by a non-zero unsigned 5-bit immediate scaled by XLEN/8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/99/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/99/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/pull/100","id":1688993056,"node_id":"PR_kwDOHfymkc5PaNpj","number":100,"title":"PR for issue 99","user":{"login":"ved-rivos","id":91900059,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXpImw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91900059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos","html_url":"https://github.com/ved-rivos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ved-rivos","id":91900059,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXpImw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91900059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos","html_url":"https://github.com/ved-rivos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ved-rivos","id":91900059,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXpImw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91900059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos","html_url":"https://github.com/ved-rivos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ved-rivos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2023-04-28T18:49:57Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T14:37:43Z","closed_at":"2023-05-03T14:37:43Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/pulls/100","html_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/pull/100","diff_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/pull/100.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/pull/100.patch","merged_at":"2023-05-03T14:37:43Z"},"body":"1.
